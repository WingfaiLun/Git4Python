Also, menopause, in the absence of HT, was associated with prolonged sleep latency and decreased deep sleep. Finally, young, healthy women compared with men experienced less sleep disturbance because of blood draws as indicated by a significantly smaller change in per cent sleep time, and percentage of stage 1 sleep. These findings suggest that women without sleep complaints sleep objectively better across age than men and the sleep of young women is more resistant to external stressors.

Acidity targeting by pHLIPs is achieved as a result of helix formation and transmembrane insertion. In contrast to the earlier technologies based on cell-penetrating peptides, pHLIPs act as monomeric membrane-inserting peptides that translocate one terminus across a membrane into the cytoplasm, while the other terminus remains in the extracellular space, locating the peptide in the membrane lipid bilayer. Therefore pHLIP has a dual delivery capability: it can tether cargo molecules or nanoparticles to the surfaces of cells in diseased tissues and/or it can move a cell-impermeable cargo molecule across the membrane into the cytoplasm. The source of energy for moving polar molecules attached to pHLIP through the hydrophobic layer of a membrane bilayer is the membrane-associated folding of the polypeptide. A drop in pH leads to the protonation of negatively charged residues (Asp or Glu), which enhances peptide hydrophobicity, increasing the affinity of the peptide for the lipid bilayer and triggering peptide folding and subsequent membrane insertion. The process is accompanied by the release of energy that can be utilized to move cell-impermeable cargo across a membrane. That the mechanism is now understood, and that targeting of tumours in mice has been shown, suggest a number of future applications of the pHLIP technology in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary']"

In addition, the variety of molecular tools available in zebrafish makes them outstanding models for helping to determine the neuromolecular mechanisms for psychoactive drugs. However, to use zebrafish as a translational model we must have validated, sensitive and efficient behavioral tests. In a series of studies, our lab has developed tests of cognitive function and stress response, which are sensitive to drug effects in a similar manner as rodent models and humans for cognitive enhancement and alleviating stress response. In particular, the three-chamber task for learning and memory was shown to be sensitive to the cognitive enhancing effects of nicotine and has been useful in helping to determine neural mechanisms crucial for nicotinic-induced cognitive enhancement. The novel tank diving test was shown to be a valid and efficient test of stress response. It is sensitive to the reduction in stress-related behaviors due to the amxiolytic drugs diazepam and buspirone but not chlordiazepoxide. Nicotine also causes stress alleviating effects which can be interpreted as anxiolytic effects.

Treatment in all patients is limited eventually by the development of acquired resistance, but little is known about the underlying mechanism. Here, we show that activation of ERBB2 signaling in cell lines, either through ERBB2 amplification or through heregulin up-regulation, leads to persistent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling and consequently to cetuximab resistance. Inhibition of ERBB2 or disruption of ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimerization restores cetuximab sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. A subset of colorectal cancer patients who exhibit either de novo or acquired resistance to cetuximab-based therapy has ERBB2 amplification or high levels of circulating heregulin. Collectively, these findings identify two distinct resistance mechanisms, both of which promote aberrant ERBB2 signaling, that mediate cetuximab resistance. Moreover, these results suggest that ERBB2 inhibitors, in combination with cetuximab, represent a rational therapeutic strategy that should be assessed in patients with cetuximab-resistant cancers.']","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cetuximab', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms', 'Neuregulin-1', 'Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']"

We present evidence that insomnia with objective short sleep duration is the most biologically severe phenotype of the disorder, as it is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal, activation of both limbs of the stress system, and a higher risk for hypertension, impaired heart rate variability, diabetes, neurocognitive impairment, and mortality. Also, it appears that objective short sleep duration is a biological marker of genetic predisposition to chronic insomnia. In contrast, insomnia with objective normal sleep duration is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal and sleep misperception but not with signs of activation of both limbs of the stress system or medical complications. Furthermore, the first phenotype is associated with unremitting course, whereas the latter is more likely to remit. We propose that short sleep duration in insomnia is a reliable marker of the biological severity and medical impact of the disorder. Objective measures of sleep obtained in the home environment of the patient would become part of the routine assessment of insomnia patients in a clinician's office setting.

We have characterized the sensory input to the cutaneous trunk muscle (CTM; also cutaneus trunci [rat] or cutaneus maximus [mouse]) reflex (CTMR), which manifests as a puckering of the dorsal thoracolumbar skin and is selectively driven by noxious stimuli. CTM electromyography and neurogram recordings in na\xefve rats revealed that CTMR responses were elicited by natural stimuli and electrical stimulation of all segments from C4 to L6, a much greater extent of segmental drive to the CTMR than previously described. Stimulation of some subcutaneous paraspinal tissue can also elicit this reflex. Using a selective neurotoxin, we also demonstrate differential drive of the CTMR by trkA-expressing and nonexpressing small-diameter afferents. These observations highlight aspects of the organization of the CTMR system that make it attractive for studies of nociception and anesthesiology and plasticity of primary afferents, motoneurons, and the propriospinal system. We use the CTMR system to demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that experimental pharmacological treatments can be compared with controls applied either to the contralateral side or to another segment, with the remaining segments providing controls for systemic or other treatment effects. These data indicate the potential for using the CTMR system as both an invasive and a noninvasive quantitative assessment tool providing improved statistical power and reduced animal use.']","['Afferent Pathways', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Animals', 'Bupivacaine', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory', 'Female', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Neural Conduction', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nociception', 'Physical Stimulation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor', 'Reflex', 'Skin', 'Somatostatin', 'Spinal Cord', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase']"

We previously showed that targeting Kras(G12D) activation and transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor type II (TGF\u03b2RII) deletion to airway basal cells via a keratin promoter induced formation of both lung AdC and SCC. In this study we assessed if targeting phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) deletion to airway basal cells could initiate lung tumor formation or increase lung SCC formation. We found that PTEN deletion is capable of initiating both lung AdC and SCC formation when targeted to basal cells and although PTEN deletion is a weaker tumor initiator than Kras(G12D) with low tumor multiplicity and long latency, tumors initiated by PTEN deletion were larger and displayed more malignant conversion than Kras(G12D) initiated tumors. That PTEN deletion did not increase lung SCC formation compared to Kras(G12D) activation, suggests that the initiating genetic event does not dictate tumor histology when genetic alterations are targeted to a specific cell.

These ambitions are often framed in terms of the simple reinstatement of enhanced plasticity in the growth-restricted milieu of an injured adult brain. Here, we provide an analysis of the similarities and differences between deprivation-induced and injury-induced cortical plasticity, to provide for a nuanced comparison of these remarkably similar processes. As a first step, we review the factors that drive ocular dominance plasticity in the primary visual cortex of the uninjured brain during the CP and in adults, to highlight processes that might confer adaptive advantage. In addition, we directly compare deprivation-induced cortical plasticity during the CP and plasticity following acute injury or ischemia in mature brain. We find that these two processes display a biphasic response profile following deprivation or injury: an initial decrease in GABAergic inhibition and synapse loss transitions into a period of neurite expansion and synaptic gain. This biphasic response profile emphasizes the transition from a period of cortical healing to one of reconnection and recovery of function. Yet while injury-induced plasticity in adult shares several salient characteristics with deprivation-induced plasticity during the CP, the degree to which the adult injured brain is able to functionally rewire, and the time required to do so, present major limitations for recovery. Attempts to recapitulate a measure of CP plasticity in an adult injury context will need to carefully dissect the circuit alterations and plasticity mechanisms involved while measuring functional behavioral output to assess their ultimate success.']","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Humans', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Recovery of Function', 'Sensory Deprivation']"

Moreover, it is clear that brain reorganization is not a ""static"" phenomenon but rather a very dynamic process. Spinal cord injury immediately initiates a change in brain state and starts cortical reorganization. In the long term, the impact of injury - with or without accompanying therapy - on the brain is a complex balance between supraspinal reorganization and spinal recovery. The degree of cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury is highly variable, and can range from no reorganization (i.e. ""silencing"") to massive cortical remapping. This variability critically depends on the species, the age of the animal when the injury occurs, the time after the injury has occurred, and the behavioral activity and possible therapy regimes after the injury. We will briefly discuss these dependencies, trying to highlight their translational value. Overall, it is not only necessary to better understand how the brain can reorganize after injury with or without therapy, it is also necessary to clarify when and why brain reorganization can be either ""good"" or ""bad"" in terms of its clinical consequences. This information is critical in order to develop and optimize cost-effective therapies to maximize functional recovery while minimizing maladaptive states after spinal cord injury.']","['Animals', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Humans', 'Learning', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Spinal Cord Injuries']"

Gel filtration analyses show that unphosphorylated DUE-B forms multiple high molecular weight (HMW) complexes.

The effect of Wnt-5a was inhibited in the presence of sFRP, a Wnt scavenger. Similarly, the canonical Wnt-3a ligand had no effect on mitochondrial fission-fusion events, suggesting that this effect is specific for Wnt-5a alone. We also show that the Wnt-5a effects on mitochondrial dynamics occur with an increase in both intracellular and mitochondrial calcium (Ca(2+)), which was correlated with an increased phosphorylation of Drp1(Ser-616) and a decrease of Ser-637 phosphorylation, both indicators of mitochondrial dynamics. Electron microscope analysis of hippocampal tissues in the CA1 region showed an increase in the number of mitochondria present in the postsynaptic region, and this finding correlated with a change in mitochondrial morphology.

In staphylococci, partial de-N-acetylation of the exopolysaccharide poly-\u03b2-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) by the extracellular protein IcaB is required for biofilm formation. To understand the molecular basis for PNAG de-N-acetylation, the structure of IcaB from Ammonifex degensii (IcaBAd) has been determined to 1.7 \xc5 resolution. The structure of IcaBAd reveals a (\u03b2/\u03b1)7 barrel common to the family four carbohydrate esterases (CE4s) with the canonical motifs circularly permuted. The metal dependence of IcaBAd is similar to most CE4s showing the maximum rates of de-N-acetylation with Ni(2+), Co(2+), and Zn(2+). From docking studies with \u03b2-1,6-GlcNAc oligomers and structural comparison to PgaB from Escherichia coli, the Gram-negative homologue of IcaB, we identify Arg-45, Tyr-67, and Trp-180 as key residues for PNAG binding during catalysis. The absence of these residues in PgaB provides a rationale for the requirement of a C-terminal domain for efficient deacetylation of PNAG in Gram-negative species. Mutational analysis of conserved active site residues suggests that IcaB uses an altered catalytic mechanism in comparison to other characterized CE4 members. Furthermore, we identified a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic loop found only in Gram-positive homologues of IcaB. Our data suggest that this loop is required for membrane association and likely anchors IcaB to the membrane during polysaccharide biosynthesis. The work presented herein will help guide the design of IcaB inhibitors to combat biofilm formation by staphylococci.']","['Acetylation', 'Amidohydrolases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Gram-Positive Endospore-Forming Rods', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Zinc', 'beta-Glucans']"

To date, all identified plant flavonoid prenyltransferases (FPTs) have been identified in Leguminosae. In the present study two new FPTs, Morus alba isoliquiritigenin 3'-dimethylallyltransferase (MaIDT) and Cudrania tricuspidata isoliquiritigenin 3'-dimethylallyltransferase (CtIDT), were identified from moraceous plants M. alba and C. tricuspidata, respectively. MaIDT and CtIDT shared low levels of homology with the leguminous FPTs. MaIDT and CtIDT are predicted to be membrane-bound proteins with predicted transit peptides, seven transmembrane regions, and conserved functional domains that are similar to other homogentisate prenyltransferases. Recombinant MaIDT and CtIDT were able to regioselectively introduce dimethylallyl diphosphate into the A ring of three flavonoids with different skeleton types (chalcones, isoflavones, and flavones). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MaIDT and CtIDT are distantly related to their homologs in Leguminosae, which suggests that FPTs in Moraceae and Leguminosae might have evolved independently. MaIDT and CtIDT represent the first two non-Leguminosae FPTs to be identified in plants and could thus lead to the identification of additional evolutionarily varied FPTs in other non-Leguminosae plants and could elucidate the biosyntheses of prenylated flavonoids in various plants.

Natural defects in insect ecdysis are frequently associated with melanization (an immunity response) occurring primarily in molting fluids, suggesting that molting fluid may impact immunity as well as affect ecdysis. To address this hypothesis, proteomic analysis of molting fluids from Bombyx mori during three different types of ecdysis was performed. Many proteins were newly identified, including immunity-related proteins, in each molting fluid. Molting fluids inhibited the growth of bacteria in vitro. The entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana, which can escape immune responses in feeding larvae, is quickly recognized by larvae during ecdysis, followed by melanization in molting fluid and old cuticle. Fungal conidia germination was delayed, and no hyphae were detected in the hemocoels of pharate instar insects. Molting fluids protect the delicate pharate instar insects with extremely thin cuticles against microorganisms. To explore the function of molting fluids in ecdysis regulation, based on protein similarity, 32 genes were selected for analysis in ecdysis regulation through RNAi in Tribolium castaneum, a model commonly used to study integument development because RNAi is difficult to achieve in B. mori. We identified 24 molting proteins that affected ecdysis after knockdown, with different physiological functions, including old cuticle protein recycling, molting fluid pressure balance, detoxification, and signal detection and transfer of molting fluids.

Treatment with ILQ inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in both TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells. ILQ-induced apoptosis was associated with the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, increased expression of Bim, and reduced expression of Bcl-2. In vitro kinase assay results revealed that ILQ inhibited the catalytic activity of both wild type and double mutant (L858R/T790M) EGFR.

However, its involvement in colon cancer and downstream molecular events is largely undefined; in particular, the mechanism by which Ascl2 regulates the plasticity of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) programs in colon cancer cells remains unknown. In this study, we systematically demonstrate that Ascl2 loss of function in colon cancer cells promotes MET by derepressing the expression of microRNA (miR)-200s (i.e. miR-200b, miR-200a, miR-429, miR-200c, and miR-141) and further activating their expression through a transcriptional mechanism that involves direct binding to the most proximal E-box (E-box2) in the miR-200b-a-429 promoter.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS), the leading cause of neonatal meningitis, can enter human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), but the host response to intracellular GBS has not been characterized. Here we sought to determine whether antibacterial autophagy, which involves selective recognition of intracellular organisms and their targeting to autophagosomes for degradation, is activated in BBB endothelium during bacterial infection. GBS infection resulted in increased punctate distribution of GFP-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and increased levels of endogenous LC3-II and p62 turnover, two hallmark indicators of active autophagic flux. Infection with GBS mutants revealed that bacterial invasion and the GBS pore-forming \u03b2-hemolysin/cytolysin (\u03b2-h/c) trigger autophagic activation. Cell-free bacterial extracts containing \u03b2-h/c activity induced LC3-II conversion, identifying this toxin as a principal provocative factor for autophagy activation. These results were confirmed in vivo using a mouse model of GBS meningitis as infection with WT GBS induced autophagy in brain tissue more frequently than a \u03b2-h/c-deficient mutant. Elimination of autophagy using Atg5-deficient fibroblasts or siRNA-mediated impairment of autophagy in hBMECs led to increased recovery of intracellular GBS. However, electron microscopy revealed that GBS was rarely found within double membrane autophagic structures even though we observed GBS-LC3 co-localization.

CDS catalyzes c1'-2-3 cyclopropanation reactions of two molecules of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) to yield chrysanthemyl diphosphate (CPP). Three proteins are known to catalyze this cyclopropanation reaction of terpene precursors. Two of them, phytoene and squalene synthase, are bifunctional enzymes with both prenyltransferase and terpene synthase activity. CDS, the other member, has been reported to perform only the prenyltransferase step. Here we show that the NDXXD catalytic motif of CDS, under the lower substrate conditions prevalent in plants, also catalyzes the next step, converting CPP into chrysanthemol by hydrolyzing the diphosphate moiety. The enzymatic hydrolysis reaction followed conventional Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a Km value for CPP of 196 \u03bcm. For the chrysanthemol synthase activity, DMAPP competed with CPP as substrate. The DMAPP concentration required for half-maximal activity to produce chrysanthemol was \u223c100 \u03bcm, and significant substrate inhibition was observed at elevated DMAPP concentrations.

Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, is known to increase cell survival by regulation of the intrinsic pathway for apoptosis. In this study, we found that Akt modulated the mevalonate pathway, which is also linked to cell survival, by increasing Rho GTPase activation. Akt modulated the pathway by phosphorylating mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) at Ser(96). This phosphorylation in macrophages increased activation of Rac1, which enhanced macrophage survival because mutation of MDD (MDDS96A) induced apoptosis. Akt-mediated activation in macrophages was specific for Rac1 because Akt did not increase activity of other Rho GTP-binding proteins. The relationship between Akt and Rac1 was biologically relevant because Akt(+/-) mice had significantly less active Rac1 in alveolar macrophages, and macrophages from Akt(+/-) mice had an increase in active caspase-9 and -3. More importantly, Akt(+/-) mice were significantly protected from the development of pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that macrophage survival is associated with the fibrotic phenotype.

How activation of these divergent signaling pathways is integrated to dictate distinct immune responses to diverse pathogens is still incompletely understood. Herein, contrary to current perception, we demonstrate that a signaling pathway defined by the inhibitor of \u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2), MAP3 kinase tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl2/MAP3K8), and MAP kinase ERK is differentially activated by TLRs. TLRs 2, 4, and 7 directly activate this inflammatory axis, inducing immediate ERK phosphorylation and early TNF\u03b1 secretion. In addition to TLR adaptor proteins, IKK\u03b2-Tpl2-ERK activation by TLR4 is regulated by the TLR4 co-receptor CD14 and the tyrosine kinase Syk. Signals from TLRs 3 and 9 do not initiate early activation of IKK\u03b2-Tpl2-ERK pathway but instead induce delayed, NADPH-oxidase-dependent ERK phosphorylation and TNF\u03b1 secretion via autocrine reactive oxygen species signaling.

Secreted Klotho (sKL) up-regulates the TRPV5 calcium channel from the cell exterior by removing sialic acids from N-glycan of the channel and inhibiting its endocytosis. Because TRPV5 and Klotho coexpress in the distal convoluted tubule, we investigated whether Klotho regulates TRPV5 action from inside the cell. Whole-cell TRPV5-mediated channel activity was recorded in HEK cells coexpressing TRPV5 and sKL or membranous Klotho (mKL). Transfection of sKL, but not mKL, produced detectable Klotho protein in cell culture media. As for sKL, mKL increased TRPV5 current density. The role of sialidase activity of mKL acting inside is supported by findings that mutations of putative sialidase activity sites in sKL and mKL abrogated the regulation of TRPV5 but that the extracellular application of a sialidase inhibitor prevented the regulation of TRPV5 by sKL only. Mechanistically, coexpression with a dominant-negative dynamin II prevented the regulation of TRPV5 by sKL but not by mKL. In contrast, blocking forward trafficking by brefeldin A prevented the effect with mKL but not with sKL. Therefore, Klotho up-regulates TRPV5 from both the inside and outside of cells. The intracellular action of Klotho is likely due to enhanced forward trafficking of channel proteins, whereas the extracellular action is due to inhibition of endocytosis.

Specific siRNAs against ezrin increase the protein level of NGX6a in these cells. During degradation, NGX6a is not ubiquitinated but is degraded through a proteasome-dependent pathway. The distribution pattern of ezrin was negatively associated with NGX6a in an immunochemistry analysis of a nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue microarray and fetus multiple organ tissues and Western blot analysis in nasopharyngeal and NPC cell lines, suggesting that ezrin and NGX6a are associated and are involved in the progression and invasion of NPC.

Caspase-2, an apoptotic initiator, can be suppressed by high levels of nutrient flux through the pentose phosphate pathway. This metabolic control is exerted via inhibitory phosphorylation of the caspase-2 prodomain by activated Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). We show here that this activation of CaMKII depends, in part, on dephosphorylation of CaMKII at novel sites (Thr(393)/Ser(395)) and that this is mediated by metabolic activation of protein phosphatase 2A in complex with the B55\u03b2 targeting subunit. This represents a novel locus of CaMKII control and also provides a mechanism contributing to metabolic control of apoptosis. These findings may have implications for metabolic control of the many CaMKII-controlled and protein phosphatase 2A-regulated physiological processes, because both enzymes appear to be responsive to alterations in glucose metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway.']","['Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2', 'Caspase 2', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glucose-6-Phosphate', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Xenopus Proteins', 'Xenopus laevis']"

The signaling mechanism, however, is unclear. To determine whether LL-37 signaling reflects specific binding to CsrS or rather a nonspecific response to LL-37-mediated membrane damage, we tested LL-37 fragments for CsrRS signaling and for GAS antimicrobial activity. We identified a 10-residue fragment (RI-10) of LL-37 as the minimal peptide that retains the ability to signal increased expression of GAS virulence factors, yet it has no detectable antimicrobial activity against GAS. Substitution of individual key amino acids in RI-10 reduced or abrogated signaling. These data do not support the hypothesis that CsrS detects LL-37-induced damage to the bacterial cell membrane but rather suggest that LL-37 signaling is mediated by a direct interaction with CsrS. To test whether LL-37 binds to CsrS, we used the purified CsrS extracellular domain to pull down LL-37 in vitro, a result that provides further evidence that LL-37 binds to CsrS. The dissociation of CsrS-mediated signaling from membrane damage by LL-37 fragments together with in vitro evidence for a direct LL-37-CsrS binding interaction constitute compelling evidence that signal transduction by LL-37 through CsrS reflects a direct ligand/receptor interaction.']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cathelicidins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinases', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virulence Factors']"

We show that the nucleotide-binding site toggles between the nucleotide binding-occluded and nucleotide binding-competent states. The conformational dynamics between these states were enhanced by binding to primed template RNA. For the WT, the occluded conformation was favored; for H273R, the competent conformation was favored. The resonance for Met-187 in our NMR spectra reported on the ability of the enzyme to check the correctness of the bound nucleotide. Kinetic experiments were consistent with the conformational dynamics contributing to the established pre-incorporation conformational change and fidelity checkpoint. For H273R, residues comprising the active site spent more time in the catalytically competent conformation and were more positively correlated than the WT. We propose that by linking the equilibrium between the binding-occluded and binding-competent conformations of the nucleotide-binding pocket and other active-site dynamics to the correctness of the bound nucleotide, faithful nucleotide incorporation is achieved.

Loss of cyt-PTPe reduces Src activity in osteoclasts, reduces resorption of mineralized matrix both in vivo and in cell culture, and induces mild osteopetrosis in young female PTPe KO mice. Activation of Src by cyt-PTPe is dependent upon this phosphatase undergoing phosphorylation at its C-terminal Tyr-638 by partially active Src. To understand how cyt-PTPe activates Src, we screened 73 Src homology 2 (SH2) domains for binding to Tyr(P)-638 of cyt-PTPe. The SH2 domain of GRB2 bound Tyr(P)-638 of cyt-PTPe most prominently, whereas the Src SH2 domain did not bind at all, suggesting that GRB2 may link PTPe with downstream molecules. Further studies indicated that GRB2 is required for activation of Src by cyt-PTPe in osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) in culture. Overexpression of GRB2 in OCLs increased activating phosphorylation of Src at Tyr-416 and of cyt-PTPe at Tyr-638; opposite results were obtained when GRB2 expression was reduced by shRNA or by gene inactivation. Phosphorylation of cyt-PTPe at Tyr-683 and its association with GRB2 are integrin-driven processes in OCLs, and cyt-PTPe undergoes autodephosphorylation at Tyr-683, thus limiting Src activation by integrins. Reduced GRB2 expression also reduced the ability of bone marrow precursors to differentiate into OCLs and reduced the fraction of OCLs in which podosomal adhesion structures assume organization typical of active, resorbing cells.

Steatosis is caused by triglycerides (TG) accumulating in lipid droplets (LDs), cellular organelles composed of neutral lipids surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids. The HCV nucleocapsid core localizes to the surface of LDs and induces steatosis in cultured cells and mouse livers by decreasing intracellular TG degradation (lipolysis). Here we report that core at the surface of LDs interferes with the activity of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the key lipolytic enzyme in the first step of TG breakdown. Expressing core in livers or mouse embryonic fibroblasts of ATGL(-/-) mice no longer decreases TG degradation as observed in LDs from wild-type mice, supporting the model that core reduces lipolysis by engaging ATGL. Core must localize at LDs to inhibit lipolysis, as ex vivo TG hydrolysis is impaired in purified LDs coated with core but not when free core is added to LDs. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that core does not directly interact with the ATGL complex but, unexpectedly, increased the interaction between ATGL and its activator CGI-58 as well as the recruitment of both proteins to LDs.

Little is known about Tpa1 as a repair protein beyond the initial observation from a high-throughput analysis indicating that deletion of TPA1 causes methyl methane sulfonate sensitivity in S. cerevisiae. Using purified Tpa1, we demonstrate that Tpa1 repairs both single- and double-stranded methylated DNA. Tpa1 is a member of the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family, and we show that mutation of the amino acid residues involved in cofactor binding abolishes the Tpa1 DNA repair activity. Deletion of TPA1 along with the base excision repair pathway DNA glycosylase MAG1 renders the tpa1\u0394mag1\u0394 double mutant highly susceptible to methylation-induced toxicity. We further demonstrate that the trans-lesion synthesis DNA polymerase Pol\u03b6 (REV3) plays a key role in tolerating DNA methyl-base lesions and that tpa1\u0394mag1rev\u03943 triple mutant is extremely susceptible to methylation-induced toxicity.

Bound VWF further recruits and activates platelets via interactions with the platelet receptor complex glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). In the present study we found proof for binding of VWF to a fibrin monomer layer during the process of fibrinogen-to-fibrin conversion in the presence of thrombin, arvin, or a snake venom from Crotalus atrox. Using a domain deletion mutant we demonstrated the involvement of the C domains of VWF in this binding. Substantial binding of VWF to fibrin monomers persisted in the presence of the FXIIIa inhibitor K9-DON, illustrating that cross-linking via factor XIII is not essential for this phenomenon and suggesting the identification of a second mechanism through which VWF multimers incorporate into a fibrin network. Under high shear conditions, platelets were shown to adhere to fibrin only if VWF had been incorporated. In conclusion, our experiments show that the C domains of VWF and the E domain of fibrin monomers are involved in the incorporation of VWF during the polymerization of fibrin and that this incorporation fosters binding and activation of platelets. Fibrin thus is not an inert end product but partakes in further thrombus growth. Our findings help to elucidate the mechanism of thrombus growth and platelet adhesion under conditions of arterial shear rate.']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Platelets', 'Fibrin', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Thrombin', 'von Willebrand Factor']"

Sixteen lectin signals significantly fluctuated in the OB, and the intensity of all three that had high affinity for \u03b11-2-fucose (\u03b11-2Fuc) glycan in the microarray was higher during the nighttime.

The most common mutation, \u0394F508, prevents CFTR from trafficking to the apical plasma membrane. Here we show that activation of the PDK1/SGK1 signaling pathway with C4-ceramide (C4-CER), a non-toxic small molecule, functionally corrects the trafficking defect in both cultured CF cells and primary epithelial cell explants from CF patients. The mechanism of C4-CER action involves a series of mutual autophosphorylation and phosphorylation events between PDK1 and SGK1. Detailed mechanistic studies indicate that C4-CER initially induces autophosphorylation of SGK1 at Ser(422). SGK1[Ser(P)(422)] and C4-CER coincidently bind PDK1 and permit PDK1 to autophosphorylate at Ser(241). Then PDK1[Ser(P)(241)] phosphorylates SGK1[Ser(P)(422)] at Thr(256) to generate fully activated SGK1[Ser(422), Thr(P)(256)]. SGK1[Ser(P)(422),Thr(P)(256)] phosphorylates and inactivates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. \u0394F508-CFTR is thus free to traffic to the plasma membrane. Importantly, C4-CER-mediated activation of both PDK1 and SGK1 is independent of the PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. Physiologically, C4-CER significantly increases maturation and stability of \u0394F508-CFTR (t\xbd \u223c10 h), enhances cAMP-activated chloride secretion, and suppresses hypersecretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8).

Our previous studies show that higher levels of placenta growth factor (PlGF), secreted by erythroid precursor cells, correlate with increased plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and other functional markers of PH in SCD. PlGF-mediated ET-1 expression occurs via activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). However, relatively less is understood regarding how PlGF-mediated expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and its downstream effector ET-1 are post-transcriptionally regulated. Herein, we show that PlGF treatment of endothelial cells resulted in reduced levels of miR-199a2, which targeted the 3'-UTR of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA and concomitantly led to augmented ET-1 expression. Plasma levels of miR-199a2 in SCD subjects were significantly lower with reciprocally high levels of plasma ET-1, unlike unaffected controls. This observation provided a molecular link between miR-199a2 and high levels of ET-1 in SCD.

WNKs bind to the CCT and trigger its conformational rearrangement to release the kinase domain of OSR1, allowing for MO25 binding and full activation.

Loss of pancreatic beta cells is a key factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes, and we have demonstrated that beta cell expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is increased in diabetes and causes beta cell apoptosis, whereas TXNIP deficiency is protective against diabetes. Recently, we found that TXNIP also impairs beta cell function by inducing microRNA (miR)-204. Interestingly, using INS-1 beta cells and primary islets, we have now discovered that expression of another microRNA, miR-200, is induced by TXNIP and by diabetes. Furthermore, we found that miR-200 targeted and decreased Zeb1 (zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1) and promoted beta cell apoptosis as measured by cleaved caspase-3 levels, Bax/Bcl2 ratio, and TUNEL. In addition, Zeb1 knockdown mimicked the miR-200 effects on beta cell apoptosis, suggesting that Zeb1 plays an important role in mediating miR-200 effects. Moreover, miR-200 increased beta cell expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, consistent with inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process thought to be involved in beta cell expansion. Thus, we have identified a novel TXNIP/miR-200/Zeb1/E-cadherin signaling pathway that, for the first time, links miR-200 to beta cell apoptosis and diabetes and also beta cell TXNIP to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, our results shed new light on the regulation and function of miR-200 in beta cells and show that TXNIP-induced microRNAs control various processes of beta cell biology.']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cdh1 Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation']"

In neuroblastoma, full-length TRPM2 (TRPM2-L) protected cells from moderate oxidative stress through increased levels of forkhead box transcription factor 3a (FOXO3a) and superoxide dismutase 2. Cells expressing the dominant negative short isoform (TRPM2-S) had reduced FOXO3a and superoxide dismutase 2 levels, reduced calcium influx in response to oxidative stress, and enhanced reactive oxygen species, leading to decreased cell viability. Here, in xenografts generated with SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably expressing TRPM2 isoforms, growth of tumors expressing TRPM2-S was significantly reduced compared with tumors expressing TRPM2-L. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1/2\u03b1 was significantly reduced in TRPM2-S-expressing tumor cells as was expression of target proteins regulated by HIF-1/2\u03b1 including those involved in glycolysis (lactate dehydrogenase A and enolase 2), oxidant stress (FOXO3a), angiogenesis (VEGF), mitophagy and mitochondrial function (BNIP3 and NDUFA4L2), and mitochondrial electron transport chain activity (cytochrome oxidase 4.1/4.2 in complex IV). The reduction in HIF-1/2\u03b1 was mediated through both significantly reduced HIF-1/2\u03b1 mRNA levels and increased levels of von Hippel-Lindau E3 ligase in TRPM2-S-expressing cells. Inhibition of TRPM2-L by pretreatment with clotrimazole or expression of TRPM2-S significantly increased sensitivity of cells to doxorubicin. Reduced survival of TRPM2-S-expressing cells after doxorubicin treatment was rescued by gain of HIF-1 or -2\u03b1 function. These data suggest that TRPM2 activity is important for tumor growth and for cell viability and survival following doxorubicin treatment and that interference with TRPM2-L function may be a novel approach to reduce tumor growth through modulation of HIF-1/2\u03b1, mitochondrial function, and mitophagy.']","['Adrenal Glands', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Autophagy', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Transport', 'TRPM Cation Channels', 'Tumor Burden']"

The level of AMPylated BiP in Drosophila S2 cells is high during homeostasis, whereas the level of AMPylated BiP decreases upon the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER.

Chronic stimulation of the \u03b22AR by long acting \u03b2-agonists used in the treatment of asthma can promote attenuated responsiveness to agonists and an increased frequency of fatal asthmatic attacks. \u03b22AR desensitization to \u03b2-agonists is primarily mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and \u03b2-arrestins that attenuate receptor-Gs coupling and promote \u03b22AR internalization and degradation. A biased agonist that can selectively stimulate Gs signaling without promoting receptor interaction with G protein-coupled receptor kinases and \u03b2-arrestins should serve as an advantageous asthma therapeutic. To identify such molecules, we screened \u223c50 lipidated peptides derived from the intracellular loops of the \u03b22AR, known as pepducins. This screen revealed two classes of Gs-biased pepducins, receptor-independent and receptor-dependent, as well as several \u03b2-arrestin-biased pepducins. The receptor-independent Gs-biased pepducins operate by directly stimulating G protein activation. In contrast, receptor-dependent Gs-biased pepducins appear to stabilize a Gs-biased conformation of the \u03b22AR that couples to Gs but does not undergo G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation or \u03b2-arrestin-mediated internalization. Functional studies in primary human airway smooth muscle cells demonstrate that Gs-biased pepducins are not subject to conventional desensitization and thus may be good candidates for the development of next generation asthma therapeutics.

A new Vibrio vulnificus Prx, named Prx3, was identified and characterized in this study. Biochemical and mutational analyses revealed that Prx3 reduces H2O2, utilizing glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3) and glutathione (GSH) as reductants, and requires only N-terminal peroxidatic cysteine for its catalysis. These results, combined with the monomeric size of Prx3 observed under non-reducing conditions, suggested that Prx3 is a Grx3/GSH-dependent 1-Cys Prx and oxidized without forming intermolecular disulfide bonds. The prx3 mutation impaired growth in the medium containing peroxides and reduced virulence in mice, indicating that Prx3 is essential for survival under oxidative stress and pathogenesis of V. vulnificus. The Fe-S cluster regulator IscR activates prx3 by direct binding to a specific binding sequence centered at -44 from the transcription start site. The binding sequence was homologous to the Type 2 IscR-binding sequence, most likely recognized by the Fe-S clusterless apo-IscR in Escherichia coli. The iscR3CA mutant, chromosomally encoding the apo-locked IscR, exhibited 3-fold higher levels of activation of prx3 than the wild type and accumulated more IscR3CA protein in cells. The IscR-dependent activation of prx3 by aerobic growth and iron starvation was also associated with the increase in cellular levels of IscR protein. Taken together, the results suggested that IscR senses iron starvation as well as reactive oxygen species and shifts to the apo-form, which leads to the increase of cellular IscR and in turn prx3 expression, contributing to the survival and virulence of V. vulnificus during pathogenesis.']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Iron', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Microbial Viability', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Peroxiredoxin III', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vibrio Infections', 'Vibrio vulnificus', 'Virulence']"

Among the three USH clinical types, type 2 (USH2) occurs most commonly. USH2A, GPR98, and WHRN are three known causative genes of USH2, whereas PDZD7 is a modifier gene found in USH2 patients. The proteins encoded by these four USH genes have been proposed to form a multiprotein complex, the USH2 complex, due to interactions found among some of these proteins in vitro, their colocalization in vivo, and mutual dependence of some of these proteins for their normal in vivo localizations. However, evidence showing the formation of the USH2 complex is missing, and details on how this complex is formed remain elusive. Here, we systematically investigated interactions among the intracellular regions of the four USH proteins using colocalization, yeast two-hybrid, and pull-down assays. We show that multiple domains of the four USH proteins interact among one another. Importantly, both WHRN and PDZD7 are required for the complex formation with USH2A and GPR98. In this USH2 quaternary complex, WHRN prefers to bind to USH2A, whereas PDZD7 prefers to bind to GPR98. Interaction between WHRN and PDZD7 is the bridge between USH2A and GPR98. Additionally, the USH2 quaternary complex has a variable stoichiometry. These findings suggest that a non-obligate, short term, and dynamic USH2 quaternary protein complex may exist in vivo. Our work provides valuable insight into the physiological role of the USH2 complex in vivo and informs possible reconstruction of the USH2 complex for future therapy.']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cercopithecus aethiops', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'PDZ Domains', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Usher Syndromes']"

The onset of decreased LPA2 mobility correlates to the spatial recruitment and coupling to LPA2-interacting proteins that anchor the complex to the cytoskeleton. These localized PDZ motif-mediated macromolecular complexes of LPA2 trigger a Ca(2+) puff gradient that governs gradient sensing and directional migration in response to LPA. Disruption of the PDZ motif-mediated assembly of the macromolecular complex of LPA2 disorganizes the gradient of Ca(2+) puffs, disrupts gradient sensing, and reduces the directional migration of fibroblasts toward LPA.

Because the Cu(2+)-binding modes at low and intermediate Cu(2+) occupancy necessarily represent the highest-affinity binding modes, these are very likely populated under physiological conditions, and it is thus essential to characterize them in order to understand better the biological function of copper-prion interactions. Besides binding-affinity data, almost no other thermodynamic parameters (e.g., \u0394H and \u0394S) have been measured, thus leaving undetermined the enthalpic and entropic factors that govern the free energy of Cu(2+) binding to the prion protein. In this study, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to quantify the thermodynamic parameters (K, \u0394G, \u0394H, and T\u0394S) of Cu(2+) binding to a peptide, PrP(23-28, 57-98), that encompasses the majority of the residues implicated in Cu(2+) binding by full-length PrP. Use of the buffer N-(2-acetomido)-aminoethanesulfonic acid (ACES), which is also a well-characterized Cu(2+) chelator, allowed for the isolation of the two highest affinity binding events. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to characterize the different binding modes as a function of added Cu(2+). The Kd values determined by ITC, 7 and 380 nM, are well in line with those reported by others. The first binding event benefits significantly from a positive entropy, whereas the second binding event is enthalpically driven.

Using plasmid rescue followed by gene disruption, we identified some of the mutated genes, including some previously implicated in chemotaxis. Among these, we studied PiaA, which encodes a critical component of TORC2, a kinase protein complex that transduces changes in motility by activating the kinase PKB (also known as Akt). Furthermore, we found that electrotaxis was decreased in mutants lacking gefA, rasC, rip3, lst8, or pkbR1, genes that encode other components of the TORC2-PKB pathway.

Here we report several novel findings that may shed light on the functional relationship between these two ion channels in the excitatory postsynaptic membrane of mouse hippocampus. Firstly, NMDAR activation induced by either NMDA or OGD led to increased [Ca(2+)](i)and greater apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths in cultured hippocampal neurons; these cell deaths were prevented by application of NMDAR antagonists. Secondly, ASIC1a activation induced by pH 6.0 extracellular solution (ECS) showed similar increases in apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths; these cell deaths were prevented by ASIC1a antagonists, and also by NMDAR antagonists. Since increased [Ca(2+)](i)leads to increased cell deaths and since NMDAR exhibits much greater calcium permeability than ASIC1a, these data suggest that ASIC1a-induced neuronal death is mediated through activation of NMDARs. Thirdly, treatment of hippocampal cultures with both NMDA and acidic ECS induced greater degrees of cell deaths than either NMDA or acidic ECS treatment alone. These results suggest that ASIC1a activation up-regulates NMDAR function. Additional data supporting the functional relationship between ASIC1a and NMDAR are found in our electrophysiology experiments in hippocampal slices, where stimulation of ASIC1a induced a marked increase in NMDAR EPSC amplitude, and inhibition of ASIC1a resulted in a decrease in NMDAR EPSC amplitude. In summary, we present evidence that ASIC1a activity facilitates NMDAR function and exacerbates NMDAR-mediated neuronal death in pathological conditions. These findings are invaluable to the search for novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of brain ischemia.']","[]"

Study 1 exposed children to dense neighbors versus non-neighbors before training sound production in evaluation of the priming hypothesis. Study 2 exposed children to the same stimuli after training sound production as a test of the phonological working memory hypothesis. Results showed that neighbors led to greater phonological generalization than non-neighbors, but only when presented prior to training production. There was little generalization and no differential effect of exposure to neighbors or non-neighbors after training production. Priming was thus supported as a possible mechanism of learning behind the dense neighborhood advantage in phonological acquisition.']","[]"

However, such therapies are currently only available against a small number of such aberrations, and new targets and therapeutics are needed. Our laboratory has previously identified the MERTK receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) as a potential drug target in multiple cancer types, including NSCLC. We have recently developed UNC2025--the first-in-class small molecule inhibitor targeting MERTK with pharmacokinetic properties sufficient for clinical translation. Here, we utilize this compound to further validate the important emerging biologic functions of MERTK in lung cancer pathogenesis, to establish that MERTK can be effectively targeted by a clinically translatable agent, and to demonstrate that inhibition of MERTK is a valid treatment strategy in a wide variety of NSCLC lines independent of their driver oncogene status, including in lines with an EGFR mutation, a KRAS/NRAS mutation, an RTK fusion, or another or unknown driver oncogene. Biochemically, we report the selectivity of UNC2025 for MERTK, and its inhibition of oncogenic downstream signaling. Functionally, we demonstrate that UNC2025 induces apoptosis of MERTK-dependent NSCLC cell lines, while decreasing colony formation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo in murine models. These findings provide further evidence for the importance of MERTK in NSCLC, and demonstrate that MERTK inhibition by UNC2025 is a feasible, clinically relevant treatment strategy in a wide variety of NSCLC subtypes, which warrants further investigation in clinical trials.""]","[]"

This yielded first the concept of participatory science and later the wider concept of participatory research. Throughout Europe, numerous collective experimentations have generated countless interactions, and new interfaces between the world of research and civil society are constantly being created. But in spite of the proliferation of these experiences, a paradox slows down their acknowledgment and legitimation. On the one hand, these interactions often go unseen and unrecognized by the institutions, public policies, and even at times their very creators. On the other hand, scientists, are still overwhelmingly wary of civil society and, perceiving only its intellectual deficit and lack of comprehension, they fail to consider the study and development of these interactions as being of primary importance. The Sciences and Society Alliance, which was recently founded in France, provides a platform where these collaborative experiences can be collected, studied, supported, communicated, and institutionally acknowledged. The launch of this process,which is soon to be European in scope, answers the need to bring science into the democratic path tread by the societies that create it.

ZCL reservoirs are rodents of the Psammomys and Meriones genera, while for SCL the dog is supposed to be a reservoir. Ctenodactylus gundii is involved in the transmission of L. killicki. However, other mammals could constitute potential reservoir hosts in Tunisia and other North African countries. In order to explore the role of hedgehogs as potential reservoirs of leishmaniasis, specimens (N=6) were captured during July-November period in 2011-2013 in an SCL endemic area in El Kef region, North-Western Tunisia. Using morphological characteristics, all specimens were described and measured. Biopsies from liver, heart, kidney and spleen of each animal were used to extract genomic DNA, which was further used in PCR assays to assess the presence of Leishmania parasites. Different PCRs targeting kinetoplast minicircles, ITS1, mini-exon genes and a repetitive Leishmania- specific sequence, were applied. To further identify Leishmania species involved, RFLP analysis of amplified fragments was performed with appropriate restriction enzymes. Using morphological characters, animals were identified as North African hedgehogs, also called Algerian hedgehogs, that belong to the Erinaceidae family, genus Atelerix Pomel 1848, and species algirus (Lereboullet, 1842). PCR results showed in total that all specimens were Leishmania infected, with different organs incriminated, mainly liver and spleen. Results were confirmed by direct sequencing of amplified fragments. Species identification showed that all specimens were infected with L. major, three of which were additionally co-infected with L. infantum. The present study demonstrates, for the first time in Tunisia, natural infection of hedgehog animals (Atelerix algirus) by the Leishmania parasites species L. major and L. infantum. L. major is also detected for the first time in wild animals captured in the North Western part of the country; likewise for the co-infection of these animals by the 2 Leishmania species. This mammal could play a potential reservoir role in epidemiology of SCL or ZCL and could contribute to emergence or extension of ZCL in the studied region.']","[]"

Following the recommendations of the WHO, Cameroon changed its malaria treatment policy from monotherapy to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. We report an investigation into trends of case management following this change in policy. Data was collected retrospectively, through consultation and perusal of laboratory and prescription registers of the Mbakong Health Centre. Analysis of data was done using SPSS and SAS Statistics. Data presented herein demonstrate that from 2006 to 2012, a total of 2484 (58.7%) of the total prescriptions included an anti-malarial, 1989 (47.0%) included an antibiotic and 1935(45.7%) included an antipyretic. The anti-malarials prescribed were Anti-malaria combination therapy (ACT) - 1216 (47.6%), quinine 1044 (40.8%) or SP 296 (11.6%). Of the 1216 patients prescribed an ACT, 441(36.3%) had a positive malaria parasite confirmation, 746 (61.3%) were negative for plasmodium. Overall, 29 patients (2.4%) were treated either with an ACT without any test performed. Quinine intake was recorded in 566 (54.2%) patients positive for plasmodium. ACT prescription increased from 23% in 2007 to between 44 and 45% in 2008-2009. During this period there was a corresponding drop in the prescription of quinine from 38% in 2007 to 13% in 2009 (r=-0.43, p>0.05). Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) was restrictively prescribed to women of childbearing age (97.0%) after 2008. Antibiotics prescription dropped from 53.7% to 39.3% from 2010 to 2012. The odds of being prescribed an antibiotic was significantly higher in patients with a malaria negative result compared to malaria positive patients (OR=6.12, CI 4.74-7.91, p<0.00001). Overall, there is an over treatment of malaria, thus departing from the WHO guidelines of appropriate treatment. Although there is an overall increase in the prescription of ACT, less prescription of quinine and a noticeable restrain from prescription of SP to febrile cases, the old practice was still rampant.

CatL1 isotypes are expressed in both early and late stages of the life cycle and the parasites use them for migration and digestion. Therefore, CatL1 is a plausible target for vaccination against this parasite. Recombinant pro-F.gigantica CatL1 (rproFgCatL1) and recombinant mature F.gigantica CatL1 (rmatFgCatL1) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The vaccination was performed in Imprinting Control Region (ICR) mice (n=10) by subcutaneous injection with 50\u03bcg of rproFgCatL1 and rmatFgCatL1 combined with Freund's adjuvant. Two weeks after the second boost, mice were infected with 15 metacercariae by the oral route. The level of protection of rproFgCatL1 and rmatFgCatL1 vaccines was estimated to be 39.1, 41.7% and 44.9, 47.2% when compared with non vaccinated-infected and adjuvant-infected controls, respectively. Antibodies in the immune sera of vaccinated mice were shown by immuno-blotting to react with the native FgCatL1 in the extract of newly excysted juveniles (NEJ), 4-week-old juveniles and the ES products of 4 week-old juveniles. By determining the levels of IgG1 and IgG2a in the immune sera, which are indicative of Th2 and Th1 immune response, respectively, it was found that both Th1 and Th2 responses were significantly increased in rproFgCatL1- and rmatFgCatL1-immunized groups compared with the control groups, with higher levels of Th2 (IgG1) than Th1 (IgG2a). The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in rmatFgCatL1-immunized group showed a significant decrease when compared to rproFgCatL1-immunized group, indicating that rmatFgCatL1-vaccinated mice had reduced liver parenchyma damage. The pathological lesions of liver in vaccinated groups were significantly decreased when compared with control groups.

Environmental concerns and insecticide selection-pressure have prompted investigations of novel, ecologically-harmless substances which can be used as insecticides. This study examined the efficacy of microencapsulated garlic-oil as the oral toxin component of ATSB for controlling Anopheles sergentii populations inhabiting desert-surrounded wetlands in Israel. ATSB solution containing 0.4% encapsulated garlic oil was applied to local vegetation around a streamlet located in the lower Jordan Valley. To determine the propensity of bait ingestion, and assess the potential ecological impact of the method, mosquito and non-target specimens were collected and tested for the presence of natural plant- or attractive sugar bait (ASB)-derived sugars. Over the experimental period, biting-pressure values in the ATSB treatment site decreased by 97.5%, while at the control site, treated with non-toxic ASB, no significant changes were observed. Approximately 70% of the mosquitoes collected before both treatments, as well as those captured following the application of ASB at the control site, were found to have ingested sugar prior to capture. Non-target insects were minimally affected by the treatment when ATSB was applied to foliage of non-flowering plants. Of the non-Diptera species, only 0.7% of the sampled non-target insects were found to have ingested ASB-solution which was applied to green vegetation, compared with 8.5% which have foraged on ASB-derived sugars applied to flowering plants. Conversely, a high proportion of the non-target species belonging to the order Diptera, especially non-biting midges, were found to have ingested foliage-applied ASB, with more than 36% of the specimens collected determined to have foraged on bait-derived sugars. These results prove that food-grade, EPA-exempt microencapsulated garlic oil is a highly effective insecticide which can be utilized for mosquito population control. The relatively short half-life of this active ingredient makes it a suitable for use in areas where repeated application is possible, limiting the accumulation of deleterious compounds and ensuring minimal environmental impact when applied in accordance with label recommendations.']","[]"

Use of immune stimulating agent with standard antileishmanial might be helpful to minimize the toxic effect of drug, shorten the dose regimen and delay the emergence of resistance. In the present study, we explored the in vitro immunomodulatory potential of an immunomodulator, leptin with lower concentration of standard drug, miltefosine. The level of Th1/Th2 cytokines, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species and phagocytic activity was assessed by ELISA, Griess reaction and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Leptin at a concentration of 15\u03bcg/mL showed heightened level of Th1 cytokines and nitric oxide generation from murine macrophages (J-774A.1 cells). Leptin (15\u03bcg/mL) also reduces the effective concentration of miltefosine by 2-folds from 7.5\u03bcM to 3.7\u03bcM. When given in conjunction with lower concentration of miltefosine (4\u03bcM), leptin (15\u03bcg/mL) significantly (***p<0.001) elevated the level of IL-12 (7.7 fold), TNF-\u03b1 (8.1 fold) and nitric oxide (6.6 fold) along with markedly (***p<0.001) suppressed level of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 when compared with untreated infected macrophages. Leptin plus miltefosine also induces the phagocytic ability (**p<0.01) of macrophages in comparison to leptin alone and miltefosine alone treated groups. These finding illustrate that leptin activates host macrophages to generate protective immune response for the successful elimination of Leishmania parasite at lower concentration of miltefosine and has potential for further exploration in experimental animal model of visceral leishmaniasis (VL).']","[]"

CAA was eluted from blood spots collected from 19 individuals onto Whatman 903 cards in Mwanza, Tanzania, and the assay was optimized to achieve CAA ratios comparable to those obtained from the spots' corresponding serum samples. The optimized assay was then used to determine the correlation of serum samples (n=16) with DBS from cards that had been stored for 8 years at ambient temperature. Using a DBS volume equivalent to approximately four times the quantity of serum, CAA testing in DBS had a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 79% compared to CAA testing in serum.

A newly developed method for the quantification of helminth eggs on hands was tested among schoolchildren in a rural South African region to look at the role hands play in helminth infection, and to determine the risk factors for hand contamination. The study found 16.6% of participants' hands positive for helminth eggs, with E. vermicularis most commonly identified. Egg concentrations on hands ranged from 0 to 57 eggs/2 hands. Gender, toilet type used at home, and not reporting to wash hands with soap before eating were all associated with the presence of eggs on hands. The study highlights the need to improve sanitation facilities, and promote handwashing with soap in schools to prevent transmission of E. vermicularis.""]","[]"

The IIL is its first invasive stage, surface proteins are directly exposed to host environment and are crucial for larval invasion and development. In this study, shotgun LC-MS/MS was used to analyze surface protein profiles of ML and IIL. Totally, 41 proteins common to both larvae, and 85 ML biased and 113 IIL biased proteins. Some proteins (e.g., putative scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain protein and putative onchocystatin) were involved in host-parasite interactions. Gene ontology analysis revealed that proteins involved in generation of precursor metabolites and energy; and nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process were enriched in IIL at level 4. Some IIL biased proteins might play important role in larval invasion and development. qPCR results confirmed the high expression of some genes in IIL. Our study provides new insights into larval invasion, host-Trichinella interaction and for screening vaccine candidate antigens.']","[]"

Thus, proper combination of immunization strategies and adjuvants are needed to increase their efficacy. We have previously protected C3H/HeN mice from Toxoplasma gondii infection by immunization with the serine protease inhibitor-1 (TgPI-1) in combination with alum. In this work, we explore an original vaccination protocol that combines administration of recombinant TgPI-1 by intradermal and intranasal routes in order to enhance protection in the highly susceptible C57BL/6 strain. Mice primed intradermally with rTgPI-1 plus alum and boosted intranasally with rTgPI-1 plus CpG-ODN elicited a strong specific Th1/Th2 humoral response, along with a mucosal immune response characterized by specific-IgA in intestinal lavages. A positive cellular response of mesentheric lymph node cells and Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion in the ileon were also detected. When immunized mice were challenged with the cystogenic Me49 T. gondii strain, they displayed up to 62% reduction in brain parasite burden. Moreover, adoptive transfer of mesenteric lymph node cells from vaccinated to na\xefve mice induced significant protection against infection. These results demonstrate that this strategy that combines the administration of TgPI-1 by two different routes, intradermal priming and intranasal boost, improves protective immunity against T. gondii chronic infection in highly susceptible mice.']","[]"

To describe clinical aspects and etiologic agents of dermatophytosis in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Patients with clinical diagnosis of dermatophytosis underwent scarification for mycological diagnosis through direct microscopic examination and fungal isolation in culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Sixty individuals had a clinical hypothesis of dermatophytosis. In 20 (33.3%) of the 60 patients, dermatophytosis was confirmed through a mycological study. Tinea corporis, diagnosed in 14 patients, was the most frequent clinical form, followed by tinea unguium in 7, tinea cruris in 5, and tinea pedis in 1 patient. Most of the lesions of tinea corporis were anergic. Five patients with tinea unguium had involvement of multiple nails, with onychodystrophy as the predominant subtype. Multiple cutaneous lesions occurred in 3 patients and extensive cutaneous lesions in 4. Regarding the agent, Trichophyton rubrum was the most commonly isolated. The high occurrence of anergic skin lesions and involvement of multiple nails, especially as onychodystrophy, corroborates the hypothesis that atypical, disseminated, and more severe presentations are common in individuals with HIV infection. However, no Microsporum species was isolated even in atypical, extensive, or disseminated cases, in disagreement with previous reports. Therefore, the approach of squamous lesions in HIV-positive patients must include a mycological study, in view of the possibility of anergic dermatophytosis, to promote the introduction of a suitable therapeutic agent.']","[]"

Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone mimic that reduces fecundity and fertility of adult Anopheles mosquitoes when used as a contact insecticide. A long-lasting insecticidal net incorporating pyriproxyfen is under development. As wild, host-seeking females may succeed in blood-feeding at different intervals after initial contact with mosquito nets the aim of this study was to determine the effect that age and gonotrophic status (nulliparous or parous) and the interval between initial pyriproxyfen exposure and blood-feeding has in terms of subsequent reduced fecundity and fertility. Anopheles gambiae s.s. were exposed to pyriproxyfen LLIN for three minutes in WHO cone bioassays. Four regimens were tested with different blood-feeding intervals A-1 hour (nulliparous), B-1 hour (parous), C-24h (nulliparous), or D-120h (nulliparous) after pyriproxyfen exposure. Mosquito oviposition rate, fecundity and fertility of eggs were recorded for several days. All four treatment regimens produced levels of mortality similar to unexposed females. The overall reduction in reproductive rate of 99.9% for regimen A relative to the untreated net was primarily due to oviposition inhibition in exposed females (97%). Pyriproxyfen was equally effective against older parous mosquitoes and when blood-feeding was 24h after exposure. Regimen D produced a reduction in reproductive rate of 60.1% but this was of lesser magnitude than other regimens and was the only regimen that failed to reduce fertility of laid eggs, indicating the effects of pyriproxyfen exposure on reproduction are to some extent reversible as mosquitoes age. In an area of moderate to high mosquito net coverage a host-seeking mosquito is likely to contact a treated mosquito net before: (a) penetrating a holed net and blood-feeding shortly after exposure or, (b) be frustrated by intact nets before succeeding in blood-feeding on an unprotected individual the following night. Mosquito nets are an appropriate delivery system for pyriproxyfen, based on the large reductions in reproductive rate when blood-feeding between 1h and 24h after exposure. Combining with a pyrethroid should be an effective approach if susceptible mosquitoes are killed and resistant mosquitoes sterilized.']","[]"

Such behavioral shifts have the potential of undermining the effectiveness of insecticide-based control interventions. The effects of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) use on the composition, biting/feeding and sporozoite rates of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes in Musilongo village, Vihiga County of western Kenya highlands were investigated. Adult mosquitoes were collected in selected sleeping spaces inside six randomly selected houses using miniature Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps. Mosquito sampling in each house was conducted twice every week for 16 consecutive months (May 2010-August 2012). At each sampling a single trap was set in the selected space inside each house such that it collected mosquitoes alternatively from 18:00 to 21:00h and 21:00 to 06:00h every week. All collected mosquitoes were morphologically identified. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were classified according to their physiological status as unfed, fed, partially gravid and gravid, sorted and counted. Members of the A. gambiae complex were identified using a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine blood meal sources and Plasmodium infection rates in A. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes. Blood meal tests were conducted on DNA extracted from gut contents of blood fed A. gambiae s.l. The head and thorax section of dried samples of A. gambiae s.l. were used in testing for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites. Overall, 735 adult female Anopheles comprising 708 [96.3%] A. gambiae s.l. and 27 [3.7%] Anopheles funestus mosquitoes were collected. A. gambiae s.l. population collected comprised, 615 [86.9%] unfed and 38 [5.4%] fed adult mosquitoes. The rest were either partially or fully gravid. The proportion of A. gambiae s.l. biting indoors within 18:00-21:00h was 15.8% (103/653) at a rate of 3.2bites per person per hour compared to 84.2% biting from 21:00-06:00h at a rate of 3.8 bites/per/h. An estimated 97.7% A. gambiae ss and 2.3% A. arabiensis constituted the indoor biting A. gambiae s.l. The population of An. gambiae s.l. biting from 18:00 to 21:00h had a Plasmodium faciparum (pf) sporozoite rate of 3.8% compared to 3.5% observed in populations biting within 21:00-06:00h. Human blood constituted 89% of An. gambiae s.l. blood meal sources. The risk of malaria transmission from 21:00 to 06:00h was approximately 5 fold the risk within 18:00-21:00h. Majority of the infective female A. gambiae s.l. adults were biting deep into the night than in the early hours of the night. Humans remain the preferred source of blood meal for A. gambiae s.s. the dominant malaria vector in the highlands. ITNs remain a fundamental control intervention against malaria transmission since female blood seekers were more during bed time than pre-bed time. Advocacy on enhanced net availability, integrity and usage in Kenyan highlands can reduce Pf transmission.

The present study evaluated the activity and synergy between liposomal-praziquantel (lip.PZQ) and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO). Mice received doses of 60 or 100mg/kg PZQ or lip.PZQ, 50 days post-infection, and after the treatment, were exposed to HBO (3 atmosphere absolute - ATA) for 1h. The viability of adult worms and oviposition were analyzed, by necropsy and Kato-Katz examination performed after 15 days of treatment.

We compared the diagnostic accuracy of real-time PCR with microscopy for the detection of S. stercoralis and hookworm in human stool samples, and investigated the inter-laboratory agreement of S. stercoralis-specific real-time PCR in two European laboratories. Stool specimens from 256 randomly selected individuals in rural C\xf4te d'Ivoire were examined using three microscopic techniques (i.e. Kato-Katz, Koga agar plate (KAP) and Baermann (BM)). Additionally, ethanol-fixed stool aliquots were subjected to molecular diagnosis. The prevalence of S. stercoralis and hookworm infection was 21.9% and 52.0%, respectively, whilst co-infections were detected in 35 (13.7%) participants. The diagnostic agreement between real-time PCR and microscopy was excellent when both KAP and BM tested positive for S. stercoralis, but was considerably lower when only one microscopic technique was positive. The sensitivity of KAP, BM and real-time PCR for detection of S. stercoralis as compared to a combination of all diagnostic techniques was 21.4%, 37.5% and 76.8%, respectively. The inter-laboratory agreement of S. stercoralis-specific PCR was substantial (\u03ba=0.63, p<0.001). We conclude that a combination of real-time PCR and stool microscopy shows high accuracy for S. stercoralis diagnosis. Besides high sensitivity, PCR may also enhance specificity by reducing microscopic misdiagnosis of morphologically similar helminth larvae (i.e. hookworm and S. stercoralis) in settings where both helminth species co-exist.""]","[]"

We compared the development time and survival of sibling larvae, reared in either water conditioned by the presence of Gambusia affinis (Baird and Girard) or fishless control-water. Our results indicate that larvae developing in fish-conditioned water (FCW) pupated faster than larvae in fishless-control water. The effect of FCW on larval survival was evident only in females. Surprisingly, FCW increased female survival. In both development-time and survival, boiling the water eliminated the FCW effect, supporting our hypothesis that fish conditioning is based on kairomones. Accelerated metamorphosis in response to predator released kairomones, evident in our results, is a rarely described phenomenon. Intuitively, when exposed to predator associated signals, aquatic larvae should metamorphose earlier to escape the higher risk of predation. However, theoretical models predict this outcome only under specific conditions. Indeed, longer - rather than shorter - time to metamorphosis is usually observed in response to predation risk. We argue that the response of larval mosquitoes to predation risk is context-dependent. Shortening larval development time may not be an exceptional response, but rather represents a part of a response spectrum that depends on the level of predation risk and resource abundance.']","[]"

Bamboo internodes and artificial breeding sites showed higher abundance, while ponds and puddles showed greater richness. Significant relationships were observed between abundance and seasonality, with a notable increase in the mosquitos abundance in the warm-rainy periods. The Shannon and Berger-Parker indices were related with interaction between seasonality and year, however separately these predictors showed no relationship with ones. The increased abundance of mosquitoes in warm-rainy months and the fact that some of the species are epidemiologically important increase not only the risk of pathogen transmission to people who frequent urban parks but also the nuisance represented by insect bites.

The sequence analysis showed the presence of two genotypes, LiA1 and LiA2, assigned to Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum, with 99.9 and 100% homology with the reference strain MHOM/TN/80/IPT1 respectively. LiA1 was identified in 18 cases (78.3%) and LiA2 in five (21.7%). Two cyt b variants of L. (L.) infantum were incriminated as the causative agents of CanL cases from three cities: Posadas, Garup\xe1, and Ituzaing\xf3. All three cities are located in the northeastern area of the country, where these parasites seem to be spreading in urban areas.']","[]"

This overview is based on articles published in the American Journal of Orthodontics, which frequently changed its name, over the past century. Additionally, other journals will be cited as craniofacial anomalies became recognized during the 20th century and the biologic basis became refined, with the new discipline of genetics replacing the term hereditary and its connotations of eugenics. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, has now provided an understanding of syndromic and nonsyndromic CLP that has led to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CLP in the 21st century. These evolving concepts will be discussed in an overview of the types of procedures published from 1915 to 2015 and the major transition in the mid-20th century from multiple uncoordinated interventions from various specialists to a coordinated team approach in which the orthodontist has a specific role in the timing and sequencing of interdisciplinary treatment goals. Major technologic advancements in treatment modalities and the contemporary approach to the health-related quality of life of the patient and the caregiver have resulted in their participation in treatment options and decisions. The requirement of informed consent reflects the legal doctrine that now emphasizes the ethical imperative of greater respect for patient autonomy in the decision-making process. The orthodontist no longer makes decisions alone, but rather with the team and the patient or the caregiver.']","[]"

The treatment alternatives and effective orthodontic techniques are described. To optimize the treatment results and prevent the recurrence of the TMD after treatment, the displaced mandible was repositioned by full-time wearing of a splint for 10 months. Adhesive bite-blocks were used to maintain the newly acquired mandibular position during fixed appliance treatment. A series of nickel-titanium and stainless steel rectangular archwires was placed in the maxillary arch to reshape it for 8 months after alignment. Finally, the displaced mandible was steadily seated into its physiologic position with fine occlusion. The TMD symptoms disappeared and never relapsed after treatment. At 2 years 3 months of retention, there was good stability. The combined splint and fixed appliance approach resolved an intractable clinical problem and avoided using additional appliances.

Review articles on this topic are voluminous, yet there seems to be no consensus as to whether endometriosis is truly a precursor of OVCA and whether any screening or risk-reducing surgery should be instituted, on the basis of our current knowledge. In this review, published data are compiled and critically appraised. Through this critical appraisal, it seems clear that the strongest evidence seems to come from prevalence data. This type of data also suggests a reduced risk of certain histotypes (mainly type II) of OVCA in women with endometriosis. This may explain the rather moderate increase in risk as shown in epidemiologic studies. Even with this moderate increase in OVCA risk, caution should be exercised because of apparent bias in favor of publication of positive results, extensive heterogeneities among prevalence estimates, and inverse relationship between estimates and sizes of the studies. Many molecular studies are conflicting, and earlier studies showing molecular aberrations involved in genomic instability and mutation that enable malignant transformation are not replicated in later studies. Given the low incidence of OVCA and the rather moderate increase in risk of mostly type I tumors, screening seems to be ill-advised, and risk-reducing surgery such as salpingectomy with or without oophorectomy does not seem to yield any substantial benefit to women with endometriosis.']","[]"

However, evidence supporting a direct link between deep endometriosis and infertility is weak. In fact, infertility in affected patients is more likely to be explained by the strong association between deep endometriosis and adhesions, superficial endometriotic implants, ovarian endometriomas, and adenomyosis. The purported beneficial effects of surgery on infertility are mainly based on the 40%-42% pregnancy rate (PR) after surgery observed in published case series. However, this level of evidence is questionable and overestimates the benefits of the intervention. Even if comparative studies are lacking, IVF may be a valid alternative. The procedure may be less effective in affected women compared with other indications and it is not without additional deep endometriosis-related risks. Some case reports suggest that lesions might progress during IVF causing ureteral or intestinal complications or can decidualize during pregnancy causing intestinal perforation, pneumothorax, and pelvic vessels rupture. Finally, in the decision-making process, physicians should also consider that women with a history of deep endometriosis may face an increased risk of pregnancy complications. In conclusion, clear recommendation for the management of infertile women with deep endometriosis cannot be extrapolated from the literature. The therapeutic decision should be based on a comprehensive evaluation that includes clinical history, instrumental findings, pain symptoms, risks of pregnancy complications, and the woman's wishes.""]","[]"

Therefore, it is crucial to prevent the recurrence of symptoms and lesions after conservative surgery. This article reviews evidence regarding the prevention of postoperative recurrence of endometriosis reported since the 1990s. Over the past 5 years, many new studies have been conducted and have demonstrated that long-term postoperative medication markedly reduces the recurrence. Most of these studies used oral contraceptives (OC), with either the cyclic or continuous regimen, while some used oral or intrauterine progestin. Continuous OC is more efficacious than cyclic OC, especially for dysmenorrhea. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is also shown to prevent recurrence of dysmenorrhea and possibly endometriosis lesions. Dienogest, a new progestin, is shown to reduce the recurrence of endometrioma. Similar to the case of ovarian endometriosis, long-term postoperative medication after conservative surgery for deep infiltrating or extragenital endometriosis seems important, although data are limited. Regardless of the lesion and the medication type, patients who discontinued medication experienced a higher incidence of recurrence, indicating that the protective effect of these medications seems to vanish rapidly after the discontinuation. On the basis of these facts, together with the pathogenesis of recurrence (retrograde menstruation and ovulation), regular and prolonged medication until the patient wishes to conceive is highly recommended to prevent the postoperative recurrence of endometriosis.']","[]"

Deep endometriosis that infiltrates multiple pelvic organs should be considered the most severe endometriotic form that poses the most difficult therapeutic uncertainties in both infertility and pelvic pain symptoms limiting quality of life. The available evidence demonstrates that endometriosis is not only a gynecologic disorder but, contrary to previous belief, its impact extends into pregnancy, delivery, and the post-partum period. The old clinical tenet that pregnancy is a cure for endometriosis may be revealed as fallacious. Safe and effective modalities to reduce the risk of the recurrence of symptoms and lesions after conservative surgery for endometriosis are now available. These treatment options should be offered post-operatively to women not immediately seeking conception. Endometriosis is associated with a moderate increase in ovarian cancer risk. However, as there are no definitive demonstrations that endometriosis constitutes per se a pre-neoplastic condition, it seems currently unwise to set-up a screening program to detect undiagnosed endometriosis in asymptomatic women. Endometriosis is not a cancer; therefore a paradigm shift from treatment of lesions to treatment of symptoms is warranted. Management should be shaped on the main clinical problem, taking into consideration a woman's preferences and priorities. Quantitative information should be provided to describe the potential benefits, potential harms, and costs of each treatment alternative. Counseling should be complete and transparent, and the duty of the caring gynecologist is to inform the woman on the pros and cons of each option and support her in the shared decision-making process.

Several hormonal and immunologic mechanisms are markedly altered in DIE compared with superficial peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis, and may explain its most aggressive behavior and the presence of severe pain symptoms. Hormonal therapies, such as combined hormonal contraceptives and progestogens, should be regarded as first-line treatment, as they are efficacious, safe, and well tolerated. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists may be used in patients with symptoms persisting after the administration of first-line therapies. Scanty literature is available for danazol treatment in patients with DIE and, however, it has become less popular due to the high rates of androgenic adverse events (AEs). The partial relief of pain that often is achieved with available therapies and its recurrence after the suspension of the treatment have brought to the development of new therapies (such as aromatase inhibitors, oral GnRH antagonists) that are currently under investigation. Surgical excision of DIE should be considered in patients with pain symptoms persisting after first-line hormonal therapies. The benefits of surgery in terms of pain improvement should be always balanced with the risk of intraoperative complications and for this reason surgical cases should be referred to tertiary centers for the treatment of DIE.

MV infection also initiates a robust type I interferon (IFN) response, resulting in the synthesis of a large number of genes, including bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (Bst2)/tetherin/CD317. Bst2 restricts the release of some enveloped viruses, but to date, its role in viral infection of neurons has not been assessed. Consequently, we investigated how Bst2 was induced and what role it played in MV neuronal infection. The magnitude of induction of neuronal Bst2 RNA and protein following IFN exposure and viral infection was notably higher than in similarly treated mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Bst2 synthesis was both IFN and Stat1 dependent. Although Bst2 prevented MV release from nonneuronal cells, its deletion had no effect on viral pathogenesis in MV-challenged mice. Our findings underscore how cell-type-specific differences impact viral infection and pathogenesis.', 'OBJECTIVE=Viral infections of the central nervous system can lead to debilitating disease and death. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that nonrenewable cells, including most central nervous system neurons, combat neurotropic viral infections in fundamentally different ways than other rapidly dividing and renewable cell populations. Here we identify type I interferon signaling as a key inducer of a known antiviral protein (Bst2) in neurons. Unexpectedly, the gene is dispensable for clearance of neurotropic viral infection despite its well-defined contribution to limiting the spread of enveloped viruses in proliferating cells. A deeper appreciation of the importance of cell type heterogeneity in antiviral immunity will aid in the identification of unique therapeutic targets for life-threatening viral infections.']","[]"

Decline in physical activity with aging is associated with a decrease in exercise capacity that predisposes to frailty. The frailty syndrome includes a lowered activity level, poor exercise tolerance, and loss of lean body and muscle mass. Poor exercise tolerance is related to aerobic endurance. Aerobic endurance training can significantly improve peak oxygen consumption by \u223c10-15%. Resistance training is the best way to increase muscle strength and mass. Although the increase in muscle mass in response to resistance training may be attenuated in frail older adults, resistance training can significantly improve muscle strength, particularly in institutionalized patients, by \u223c110%. Because both aerobic and resistance training target specific components of frailty, studies combining aerobic and resistance training provide the most promising evidence with respect to successfully treating frailty. At the molecular level, exercise reduces frailty by decreasing muscle inflammation, increasing anabolism, and increasing muscle protein synthesis. More studies are needed to determine which exercises are best suited, most effective, and safe for this population. Based on the available studies, an individualized multicomponent exercise program that includes aerobic activity, strength exercises, and flexibility is recommended to treat frailty.']","[]"

Type I interferon is crucial for control of viral replication and spread in the natural host, but the specific contributions of MDA5 signaling to this pathway as well as to pathogenesis and subsequent immune responses are largely unknown. In this study, we use MHV infection of the liver as a model to demonstrate that MDA5 signaling is critically important for controlling MHV-induced pathology and regulation of the immune response. Mice deficient in MDA5 expression (MDA5(-/-) mice) experienced more severe disease following MHV infection, with reduced survival, increased spread of virus to additional sites of infection, and more extensive liver damage than did wild-type mice. Although type I interferon transcription decreased in MDA5(-/-) mice, the interferon-stimulated gene response remained intact. Cytokine production by innate and adaptive immune cells was largely intact in MDA5(-/-) mice, but perforin induction by natural killer cells and levels of interferon gamma, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in serum were elevated. These data suggest that MDA5 signaling reduces the severity of MHV-induced disease, at least in part by reducing the intensity of the proinflammatory cytokine response.', 'OBJECTIVE=Multicellular organisms employ a wide range of sensors to detect viruses and other pathogens. One such sensor, MDA5, detects viral RNA and triggers induction of type I interferons, chemical messengers that induce inflammation and help regulate the immune responses. In this study, we sought to determine the role of MDA5 during infection with mouse hepatitis virus, a murine coronavirus used to model viral hepatitis as well as other human diseases. We found that mice lacking the MDA5 sensor were more susceptible to infection than were mice with MDA5 and experienced decreased survival. Viral replication in the liver was similar in mice with and without MDA5, but liver damage was increased in MDA5(-/-) mice, suggesting that the immune response is causing the damage. Production of several proinflammatory cytokines was elevated in MDA5(-/-) mice, suggesting that MDA5 may be responsible for keeping pathological inflammatory responses in check.']","[]"

Despite that mortality has been consistently associated with organ compromise, the mechanisms by which sepsis causes multiple organ dysfunction are not well understood, and hence, therapy remains reactive and non-specific. Recent studies have challenged previous paradigms by demonstrating that acute kidney injury can occur in the setting of a normal or an even increased renal blood flow, and that it is characterized by tubular injury and not by necrosis or apoptosis. This finding suggests that mechanisms other than hypoperfusion may be at play, and that adaptive responses of the tubular epithelial cell may be key to understanding the origin of organ dysfunction in the setting of sepsis. In this review, we discuss evidence suggesting that the activation of energy regulatory processes and mitochondrial quality control processes may not only be drivers of this response, but also be factors that may alter the course of organ dysfunction during sepsis in clinically relevant ways.']","[]"

PTEN also plays a role in the maintenance of genomic stability in the nucleus. Here we report that PTEN facilitates DNA decatenation and controls a decatenation checkpoint. Catenations of DNA formed during replication are decatenated by DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2), and this process is actively monitored by a decatenation checkpoint in G2 phase. We found that PTEN deficient cells form ultra-fine bridges (UFBs) during anaphase and these bridges are generated as a result of insufficient decatenation. We show that PTEN is physically associated with a decatenation enzyme TOP2A and that PTEN influences its stability through OTUD3 deubiquitinase. In the presence of PTEN, ubiquitination of TOP2A is inhibited by OTUD3. Deletion or deficiency of PTEN leads to down regulation of TOP2A, dysfunction of the decatenation checkpoint and incomplete DNA decatenation in G2 and M phases. We propose that PTEN controls DNA decatenation to maintain genomic stability and integrity.']","[]"

We identify an age-dependent lipid homeostasis pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans that regulates the mobilization of lipids from the soma to the germline, which supports fecundity but at the cost of survival in nutrient-poor and oxidative stress environments. This trade-off is responsive to the levels of dietary carbohydrates and organismal oleic acid and is coupled to activation of the cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1 in both laboratory-derived and natural isolates of C. elegans. The homeostatic balance of lipid stores between the somatic and germ cells is mediated by arachidonic acid (omega-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (omega-3) precursors of eicosanoid signaling molecules. Our results describe a mechanism for resource reallocation within intact animals that influences reproductive fitness at the cost of somatic resilience.']","[]"

In order to reduce the incidence of lung injury using preemptive mechanical ventilation, it is important to recognize the influence of altered chest wall mechanics on disease pathogenesis.

To accommodate the increasing need of analyzing very large NGS data sets, it is necessary to develop faster, more sensitive and accurate mapping tools.', 'RESULTS=HIA uses two indices, a hash table index and a suffix array index. The hash table performs direct lookup of a q-gram, and the suffix array performs very fast lookup of variable-length strings by exploiting binary search. We observed that combining hash table and suffix array (hybrid index) is much faster than the suffix array method for finding a substring in the reference sequence. Here, we defined the matching region (MR) is a longest common substring between a reference and a read. And, we also defined the candidate alignment regions (CARs) as a list of MRs that is close to each other.

The transformation from a normal to a cancerous cell requires metabolic changes to fuel the high metabolic demands of cancer cells, including but not limited to cell proliferation and cell migration. In recent years, there have been a number of new discoveries connecting known aberrations in oncogenic and tumour suppressor pathways with metabolic alterations required to sustain cell proliferation and migration. However, an understanding of the selective advantage of these metabolic alterations is still lacking. Here, we review the literature on mathematical models of metabolism, with an emphasis on their contribution to the identification of the selective advantage of metabolic phenotypes that seem otherwise wasteful or accidental. We will show how the molecular hallmarks of cancer can be related to cell proliferation and tissue remodelling, the two major physiological requirements for the development of a multicellular structure. We will cover different areas such as genome-wide gene expression analysis, flux balance models, kinetic models, reaction diffusion models and models of the tumour microenvironment. We will also highlight current challenges and how their resolution will help to achieve a better understanding of cancer metabolism and the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancers.']","[]"

In contrast to the subcutaneous route, SLIT requires a much greater amount of antigen to achieve a clinical effect. Many studies have shown that SLIT involves a dose-response relationship, and therefore it is important to use a proven clinically effective dose from the onset of treatment, because low doses are ineffective and very high doses may increase the risk of side effects. A well-defined standardization of allergen content is also crucial to ensure consistent quality, potency and appropriate immunomodulatory action of the SLIT product. Several methods of measuring antigenicity are used by manufacturers of SLIT products, including the index of reactivity (IR), standardized quality tablet unit, and bioequivalent allergy unit. A large body of evidence has established the 300 IR dose of SLIT as offering optimal efficacy and tolerability for allergic rhinitis due to grass and birch pollen and HDM, and HDM-induced moderate, persistent allergic asthma. The 300 IR dose also offers consistency of dosing across a variety of different allergens, and is associated with higher rates of adherence and patient satisfaction. Studies in patients with grass pollen allergies showed that the 300 IR dose has a rapid onset of action, is effective in both adults and children in the short term and, when administered pre-coseasonally in the long term, and maintains the clinical benefit, even after cessation of treatment. In patients with HDM-associated AR and/or asthma, the 300 IR dose also demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms and quality of life, and significantly decreased use of symptomatic medication. The 300 IR dose is well tolerated, with adverse events generally being of mild or moderate severity, declining in frequency and severity over time and in the subsequent courses. We discuss herein the most important factors that affect the selection of the optimal dose of SLIT with natural allergens, and review the rationale and evidence supporting the use of the 300 IR dose.']","[]"

The Genomics APIs are a set of special protocols that assist software developers in dealing with multiple genomic data sources for building seamless, interoperable applications leading to the advancement of both genomic and clinical research. These APIs help define a standard for retrieval of genomic data from multiple sources as well as to better package genomic information for integration with Electronic Health Records. This review covers three currently available Genomics APIs: a) Google Genomics, b) SMART Genomics, and c) 23andMe. The functionalities, reference implementations (if available) and authentication protocols of each API are reviewed.

Su(H) is a transcription factor that together with several cofactors regulates the expression of Notch target genes. Here we address the consequences of a local induction of three Su(H) variants on Notch target gene expression. To this end, wild-type Su(H), a phospho-deficient Su(H) (MAPK-) (ko) and a phospho-mimetic Su(H) (MAPK-ac) isoform were overexpressed in the central domain of the wing anlagen. The expression of the Notch target genes cut, wingless, E(spl)m8-HLH and vestigial, was monitored. For the latter two, reporter genes were used (E(spl)m8-lacZ, vg (BE) -lacZ). In general, Su(H) (MAPK-) (ko) induced a stronger response than wild-type Su(H), whereas the response to Su(H) (MAPK-ac) was very weak. Notch target genes cut, wingless and vg (BE) -lacZ were ectopically activated, whereas E(spl)m8-lacZ was repressed by overexpression of Su(H) proteins. In addition, in epistasis experiments an activated form of the EGF-receptor (DER (act) ) or the MAPK (rl (SEM) ) and individual Su(H) variants were co-overexpressed locally, to compare the resultant phenotypes in adult flies (thorax, wings and eyes) as well as to assay the response of the Notch target gene cut in cell clones.']","[]"

Consistently and best studied in insects and vertebrates, many signaling pathways relaying the activity of eye developmental factors to positional information in the head region are characterized. Though known from several organisms, photoreceptors developing outside the head region are much less studied and the course of their development, relation to cerebral eyes and evolutionary origin is in most cases unknown. To explore how position influences development of otherwise similar photoreceptors, we analyzed the molecular characteristics of photoreceptors we discovered at the very anterior, the posttrochal mid-body and posterior body region of larval Leptochiton asellus, a representative of the chiton subgroup of mollusks.', 'RESULTS=Irrespective of their position, all found photoreceptors exhibit a molecular signature highly similar to cerebral eye photoreceptors of related animals. All photoreceptors employ the same subtype of visual pigments (r-opsin), and the same key elements for phototransduction such as GNAq, trpC and arrestin and intracellular r-opsin transport such as rip11 and myosinV as described from other protostome cerebral eyes. Several transcription factors commonly involved in cerebral eye and brain development such as six1/2, eya, dachshund, lhx2/9 and prox are also expressed by all found photoreceptor cells, only pax6 being restricted to the anterior most cells. Coexpression of pax6 and MITF in photoreceptor-associated shielding pigment cells present at the mid-body position matches the common situation in cerebral eye retinal pigment epithelium specification and differentiation. Notably, all photoreceptors, even the posterior ones, further express clear anterior markers such as foxq2, irx, otx, and six3/6 (only the latter absent in the most posterior photoreceptors), which play important roles in the early patterning of the anterior neurogenic area throughout the animal kingdom.', 'CONCLUSIONS=Our data suggest that anterior eyes with brain-associated development can indeed be subject to heterotopic replication to developmentally distinct and even posterior body regions. Retention of the transcriptional activity of a broad set of eye developmental factors and common anterior markers suggests a mode of eye development induction, which is largely independent of body regionalization.']","[]"

Because the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is the main glycolytic route in this bacterium, determining how much NADH and NADPH are produced in the reaction catalyzed by these enzymes is very important for the correct interpretation of metabolic flux distributions. To determine the actual cofactor preference of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase encoded by the zwf-1 gene (PputG6PDH-1), the major isoform during growth on glucose, we purified this protein and studied its kinetic properties. Based on simple kinetic principles, we estimated the in vivo relative production of NADH and NADPH during the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Contrary to the general assumption, our calculations showed that the reaction catalyzed by PputG6PDH-1 yields around 1/3\xa0mol of NADPH and 2/3\xa0mol of NADH per mol of oxidized G6P. Additionally, we obtained data suggesting that the reaction catalyzed by the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is active during growth on glucose, and it also produces NADH. These results indicate that the stoichiometric matrix of in silico models of P. putida KT2440 must be corrected and highlight the importance of considering the physiological concentrations of the involved metabolites to estimate the actual proportion of NADH and NADPH produced by a dehydrogenase.']","[]"

It is based on the assumption that at the time of the crime, the defendant was suffering from severe mental illness and therefore, was incapable of appreciating the nature of the crime and differentiating right from wrong behavior, hence making them not legally accountable for crime. Insanity defense is a legal concept, not a clinical one (medical one). This means that just suffering from a mental disorder is not sufficient to prove insanity. The defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by a ""preponderance of the evidence"" which is similar to a civil case. It is hard to determine legal insanity, and even harder to successfully defend it in court. This article focuses on the recent Supreme Court decision on insanity defense and standards employed in Indian court. Researchers present a model for evaluating a defendant\'s mental status examination and briefly discuss the legal standards and procedures for the assessment of insanity defense evaluations.

There seems to be a specific relation between OCD symptom dimensions and obsessive beliefs, but the findings are not consistent across studies.

Between January 2008 and March 2013, 56 patients (36 male, 20 female; mean age 25.6\xa0years, age range 16-39\xa0years) underwent single-port microthoracoscopic thoracic sympathicotomy for palmar hyperhidrosis. Nineteen patients (33.9\xa0%) had moderate palmar hyperhidrosis that could thoroughly wet a handkerchief, and 37 (66.1\xa0%) had severe palmar hyperhidrosis with sweat dripping from the palm. Eight patients (14.3\xa0%) had a positive family history, 34 (60.7\xa0%) had plantar hyperhidrosis, 22 (39.3\xa0%) had axillary hyperhidrosis, and 20 (35.7\xa0%) had both plantar and axillary hyperhidrosis. In addition, 21 patients (37.5\xa0%) had palmar pompholyx, five (8.9\xa0%) had keratolysis exfoliativa, 10 (17.9\xa0%) had chilblains, and nine (16.1\xa0%) had palmar rhagades. A single 10-mm skin incision was made in the third intercostal space at the anterior axillary line, posterior to the pectoralis muscle. A 5-mm microthoracoscope and a 3-mm microelectrocautery hook were inserted through a single port into the thoracic cavity. The third and fourth ribs were identified, and the sympathetic chain was cut using the microelectrocautery hook. The bypassing nerve fibers, such as the Kuntz nerve fiber bundle, were ablated for 2-3\xa0cm along the surface of the rib. The palmar temperature was recorded before and after sympathicotomy. All 56 procedures were completed using single-port microthoracoscopy. No postoperative complications such as hemorrhage, wound infection, hemopneumothorax, bradycardia, or Horner's syndrome were observed. Bilateral procedures were completed in 20-56\xa0min (mean 30\xa0min). The palmar temperature increased by 2.2\u2009\xb1\u20090.3\xa0\xb0C after surgery. The postoperative hospital stay was 1-4\xa0days (mean 2.5\xa0days). Mild compensatory sweating of the back and thigh occurred in five patients (8.9\xa0%) at 2-3\xa0days after surgery and disappeared at 7-15\xa0days. The patients were followed up for 28.5\xa0months (range 1-62\xa0months). Hyperhidrosis resolved in both hands after surgery, and the previously wet, cold hands became dry and warm. The efficacy rate was 100\xa0%. Plantar hyperhidrosis was also significantly reduced in 33 of the 34 patients with this condition (remission rate 97.1\xa0%), and axillary hyperhidrosis was significantly reduced in 19 of 22 patients (remission rate 86.4\xa0%). Eighteen of the 20 patients (90.0\xa0%) with both plantar and axillary hyperhidrosis experienced significant alleviation of their symptoms. Single-port microthoracoscopic thoracic sympathicotomy is a safe, convenient, and effective method of treating palmar hyperhidrosis. This procedure can accurately locate the sympathetic chain with a small incision, minimal invasiveness, and good cosmetic results. The procedure is suitable for extensive clinical use.""]","[]"

A total of 2211 patients undergoing general surgical procedures between December 2006 and November 2008 at Iizuka Hospital and between January 2010 and March 2012 at Jichi Medical University Hospital were reviewed. Multiple logistic regression models were used to evaluate serum total cholesterol and other variables as predictors of postoperative nosocomial infections. Serum total cholesterol concentrations lower than 160\xa0mg/dl were associated with an increased incidence of superficial and deep incisional surgical site infections. Serum total cholesterol levels showed a reverse J-shaped relationship with the development of organ space surgical site infection and pneumonia. There was no discernible effect of serum cholesterol levels on the postoperative mortality observed in this cohort of patients. Decreased serum albumin was one of the strongest risk factors for the development of nosocomial infection after surgery. Postoperative pneumonia was not observed in patients taking statin medications whose cholesterol levels were <200\xa0mg/dl. Serum total cholesterol may be a valid predictor of surgical outcome.

Preinterventional study was done by collecting data regarding the use of surgical prophylaxis in the Department of Surgery. After analyzing the preinterventional data, educational intervention was done. A pretest questionnaire was given to all the surgeons to assess knowledge and practice of surgical prophylaxis in our institute. The questionnaire was designed to collect information regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotic, its duration, time of administration, and prevention of surgical site infections (SSI). In our study, third-generation cephalosporin was used in maximum cases in preinterventional analysis and prophylaxis was continued for 3-5\xa0days. Surgeon's decision in selecting a prophylactic agent was based on information taken from departmental colleagues or drug companies. Two or more doses of antibiotic were used even when duration of surgery did not exceed more than two and half hours. Definite improvement was seen after the education where single antibiotic was used as prophylactic drug and the first dose of antibiotic was administered 30 to 60\xa0min before incision. This shows that educational intervention makes a change in antibiotic prescribing habit.

But in addition to the benefits, some more problems have come in picture major being 'mesh infection'. Prolene mesh has shown promise when used in abdominal and inguinal hernia repair, especially when used in planned surgeries. This material, derived from monofilament polypropelene, is found to be biologically inert in almost every person. Being a foreign material, a slightest breach in asepsis can lead to favourable environment for bacterial proliferation and form a 'biofilm'. This phenomenon especially after laparoscopic surgeries gives rise to chronic discharging sinus at the port site, abscess formation around mesh and even sepsis. It appears that laparoscopic hernia repair is a promising method but having chances of mesh infection owing to difficult approach and lack of uniformity in sterilization of laparoscopic instruments. Slightest breach in sterility or protocols might lead to such a large ventral wall sinus, increasing morbidity and cost of treatment. Treatment of infected mesh is possible by local debridement, irrigation, mesh removal and systemic antibiotics culminating in increased morbidity over duration of disease, but still it would be worth emphasizing-'Prevention is better than cure'.""]","[]"

With regard to flexing, we: (1) Established the minimum flexing performance needed to meet clinical requirements, (2) developed flexing performance tests which mimic clinical requirement, and (3) evaluated the mechanical properties of various guide wires relative to these requirements. With regard to tensile strength, we used the testing method prescribed in ISO 11070, but did not end the test at 5 Newton (N). We continued until the guide wire was damaged, or we reached maximum tractive force. We then did a wire-to-wire comparison. We examined two basic wire constructions, monofil and core and coil.', u'RESULTS=Tensile strength: All wires tested, except one, met EN ISO 11070 requirements for 5 N tensile strength. The mean of the wire types tested ranged from 15.06 N to 257.76 N. Flexing performance: None of the wires kinked. The monofil had no evidence of bending.

Many studies show that CYP11A1 plays a role in ovary function. However, the role of CYP11A1 in goose reproductive cycle remains largely unknown.', ""RESULTS=In this study, full-length CYP11A1 cDNA of Zhedong goose was obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA consisted of a 96-base pair (bp) 5'untranslated region (UTR), a 179-bp 3'UTR and a 1509-bp open reading frame. The open reading frame encodes a putative 503 amino acid protein that shares high homology with CYP11A1 of other birds. The amino acid sequence possesses conserved domains of the P450 superfamily, which include the steroid-binding domain and the heme-binding region. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed CYP11A1 mRNA was expressed ubiquitously in every Zhedong goose tissue analyzed, including the heart, liver, glandular stomach, lung, spleen, kidney, intestinum tenue, intestinum crassum, cerebrum, cerebellum, muscle, oviduct, pituitary, hypothalamus and ovary..

During an electrophysiological study, NSVTs reproducibly recurred only after right ventricular (RV) pacing; LV pacing did not induce any NSVTs. The activation map was consistent with a localized reentry at the interventricular septum, and a double exit; at the LV exit site, a single radiofrequency energy application immediately interrupted the occurrence of the NSVTs.

Developing biotechnology approaches for the production of these compounds in heterologous hosts can increase their market availability, reduce their cost, and provide sustainable production platforms. In this context, we aimed at producing the antimicrobial diterpenoid isopimaric acid from Sitka spruce. Isopimaric acid is synthesized using geranylgeranyl diphosphate as a precursor molecule that is cyclized by a diterpene synthase in the chloroplast and subsequently oxidized by a cytochrome P450, CYP720B4.', u'RESULTS=We transiently expressed the isopimaric acid pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and enhanced its productivity by the expression of two rate-limiting steps in the pathway (providing the general precursor of diterpenes). This co-expression resulted in 3-fold increase in the accumulation of both isopimaradiene and isopimaric acid detected using GC-MS and LC-MS methodology. We also showed that modifying or deleting the transmembrane helix of CYP720B4 does not alter the enzyme activity and led to successful accumulation of isopimaric acid in the infiltrated leaves.

Coumarin-rich grass species are well known in folk tradition in northernmost Norway, as luktegress (Norwegian, ""scent grass""), h\xe1issasuoidni (North S\xe1mi, ""scent grass""), hajuhein\xe4 (Finnish, ""scent grass""), or similar terms.

When cellular images from any laboratory are digitized, scanned, and stored, some kind of degradation occurs, and directly using a rank-ordered filter may not produce clear edges. These images contain uncertainties, present in edges or boundaries of the image. Fuzzy sets that take into account these uncertainties may be a good tool to process these images. However, a fuzzy set sometimes does not produce better results. We used an interval type II fuzzy set, which considers the uncertainty in a different way. It considers the membership function in the fuzzy set as ""fuzzy,"" so the membership values lie within an interval range. A type II fuzzy set has upper and lower membership levels, and with the two levels, a new membership function is computed using Hamacher t-conorm. A new fuzzy image is formed. A rank-ordered filter is applied to the image to obtain an edge-enhanced image. The proposed method is compared with the existing methods visually and quantitatively using entropic method.

Also unknown is the influence of therapeutic escalation using recommended agents on the serum level of 25(OH)D. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of abnormal 25(OH)D concentrations in CHF patients and to establish the clinical and laboratory determinants of low activity of this metabolite.', 'METHODS=The retrospective analysis included the data of 412 CHF patients not receiving optimal pharmacological treatment who were initially in NYHA (New York Heart Association) class III or IV. Over the period of 3 months the therapy was escalated until reaching maximum tolerated doses or those recommended by the current guidelines.

Most often, MCS has emerged as a bridge to transplantation, but more recently it is also used as a destination therapy. Mechanical circulatory support includes left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or bi-ventricular assist device (Bi-VAD). Currently, 2- to 3-year survival in carefully selected patients is much better than with medical therapy. However, MCS therapy is hampered by sometimes life-threatening complications including bleeding and device thrombosis. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) has two major functions in haemostasis. First, it plays a crucial role in platelet-subendothelium adhesion and platelet-platelet interactions (aggregation). Second, it is the carrier of factor VIII (FVIII) in plasma. Von Willebrand factor prolongs FVIII half-time by protecting it from proteolytic degradation. It delivers FVIII to the site of vascular injury thus enhancing haemostatic process. On one hand, high plasma levels of vWF have been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. On the other, defects or deficiencies of vWF underlie the inherited von Willebrand disease or acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Here we review the pathophysiology of thrombosis and bleeding associated with vWF.']","[]"

In the present study, 100,540,130 high-quality paired-end reads were obtained from six cDNA libraries of spleen, liver, gill, kidney, muscle, and brain with 28.4\xa0GB data using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Tissue-specific transcriptomes as well as complete transcriptome assembly were analyzed for concise representation of the study. In brief, the de novo assembly of individual tissue resulted in an average of 31,829 (18,512-46,348) contigs per sample, while combined transcriptome comprised 77,907 unique transcript fragments (unigenes) assembled from reads of six tissues.

Although there is availability of a plethora of therapeutically effective antihypertensive molecules, inadequate patient welfare is observed; this arguably presents an opportunity to deliver antihypertensive agents through a different route. Ever since the transdermal drug delivery came into existence, it has offered great advantages including non-invasiveness, prolonged therapeutic effect, reduced side effects, improved bioavailability, better patient compliance and easy termination of drug therapy. Attempts were made to develop the transdermal therapeutic system for various antihypertensive agents, including \u03b2-blockers, an important antihypertensive class. \u03b2-blockers are potent, highly effective in the management of hypertension and other heart ailments by blocking the effects of normal amounts of adrenaline in the heart and blood vessels.

Prospective cross-sectional observational study conducted at the Cardiology Department and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Assiut University Hospitals. One-hundred and twenty patients were enrolled in the study from July 2013 to January 2014. Outcome measures were discharge INRs, bleeding and thromboembolic episodes. Bivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression were conducted to determine independent risk factors that can keep patients outside target INR range. Patients who were newly initiated warfarin on hospital admission were given low initiation dose (2.8\xa0mg\xa0\xb1\xa00.9). They were more likely to have INR values below 1.5 during hospital stay, 13 (27.7%) patients compared with 9 (12.3%) previously treated patients, respectively (p\xa0=\xa0.034). We found that the best predictors of achieving below target INR range relative to within target INR range were; shorter hospital stay periods (OR, 0.82 for every day increase [95% CI, 0.72-0.94]), being a male patient (OR, 2.86 [95% CI, 1.05-7.69]), concurrent infection (OR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07-0.59]) and new initiation of warfarin therapy on hospital admission (OR, 3.73 [95% CI, 1.28-10.9]). Gender, new initiation of warfarin therapy on hospital admission, shorter hospital stay periods and concurrent infection can have a significant effect on discharge INRs. Initiation of warfarin without giving loading doses increases the risk of having INRs below 1.5 during hospital stay and increases the likelihood of a patient to be discharged with INR below target range. Following warfarin dosing nomograms and careful monitoring of the effect of various factors on warfarin response should be greatly considered.']","[]"

This warming has strongly affected the cryosphere, causing the largest ice-shelf collapses ever observed and the retreat of 87% of glaciers. Ecosystem responses, although increasingly predicted, have been mainly reported for pelagic systems. However, and despite most Antarctic species being benthic, responses in the Antarctic benthos have been detected in only a few species, and major effects at assemblage level are unknown. This is probably due to the scarcity of baselines against which to assess change.

The sudden shift from a ""filter feeders-ascidian domination"" to a ""mixed assemblage"" suggests that thresholds (for example, of tolerable sedimentation) and alternative equilibrium states, depending on the reversibility of the changes, could be possible traits of this ecosystem.

We study the interplay between magnetism and electric polarization in the lacunar spinel GaV4S8, which undergoes a structural transition associated with orbital ordering at 44 K and reveals a complex magnetic phase diagram below 13 K, including ferromagnetic, cycloidal, and N\xe9el-type skyrmion lattice (SkL) phases. We found that the orbitally ordered phase of GaV4S8 is FE with a sizable polarization of ~1 \u03bcC/cm(2). Moreover, we observed spin-driven excess polarizations in all magnetic phases; hence, GaV4S8 hosts three different multiferroic phases with coexisting polar and magnetic order. These include the SkL phase, where we predict a strong spatial modulation of FE polarization close to the skyrmion cores. By taking into account the crystal symmetry and spin patterns of the magnetically ordered phases, we identify exchange striction as the main microscopic mechanism behind the spin-driven FE polarization in each multiferroic phase. Because GaV4S8 is unique among known SkL host materials owing to its polar crystal structure and the observed strong magnetoelectric effect, this study is an important step toward the nondissipative electric field control of skyrmions.""]","[]"

All of the models show the typical and well-documented brittle fracture behavior of polycrystalline graphene; however, a clear decrease in all fracture properties is observed with increasing annealing time. The remarkably high fracture properties obtained for the most disordered (less annealed) structures arise from the formation of many nonpropagating prefracture cracks, significantly retarding failure. The stability of these reversible cracks is due to the nonlocal character of load transfer after a bond rupture in very disordered systems. It results in an insufficient strain level on neighboring bonds to promote fracture propagation.

We present evidence for three ancient genome duplications during the evolution of gymnosperms, based on phylogenomic analyses of transcriptomes from 24 gymnosperms and 3 outgroups. We use a new algorithm to place these WGD events in phylogenetic context: two in the ancestry of major conifer clades (Pinaceae and cupressophyte conifers) and one in Welwitschia (Gnetales).

Contrary to previous genomic research that reported an absence of polyploidy in the ancestry of contemporary gymnosperms, our analyses indicate that polyploidy has contributed to the evolution of conifers and other gymnosperms.

We use phylogenetic reconstruction, electron microscopy, spectrophotometry, and optical modeling to show an opposing pattern of nanostructural diversification accompanied by unusual conservation of blue color in tarantulas (Araneae: Theraphosidae). In contrast to other clades, blue coloration in phylogenetically distant tarantulas peaks within a narrow 20-nm region around 450 nm. Both quasi-ordered and multilayer nanostructures found in different tarantulas produce this blue color. Thus, even within monophyletic lineages, tarantulas have evolved strikingly similar blue coloration through divergent mechanisms. The poor color perception and lack of conspicuous display during courtship of tarantulas argue that these colors are not sexually selected. Therefore, our data contrast with sexual selection that typically produces a diverse array of colors with a single structural mechanism by showing that natural selection on structural color in tarantulas resulted in convergence on similar color through diverse structural mechanisms.']","[]"

Glaciated landscapes record the erosional legacy of glacial intervals through moraine deposits and U-shaped valleys, whereas more widespread unglaciated hillslopes and rivers lack obvious climate signatures, hampering mechanistic theory for how climate sets fluxes and form. Today, periglacial processes in high-elevation settings promote vigorous bedrock-to-regolith conversion and regolith transport, but the extent to which frost processes shaped vast swaths of low- to moderate-elevation terrain during past climate regimes is not well established. By combining a mechanistic frost weathering model with a regional Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate reconstruction derived from a paleo-Earth System Model, paleovegetation data, and a paleoerosion archive, we propose that frost-driven sediment production was pervasive during the LGM in our unglaciated Pacific Northwest study site, coincident with a 2.5 times increase in erosion relative to modern rates. Our findings provide a novel framework to quantify how climate modulates sediment production over glacial-interglacial cycles in mid-latitude unglaciated terrain.']","[]"

Our data show that D. patagonica and modern burrowing squamates share a unique spherical vestibule in the inner ear, as compared with swimmers and habitat generalists. We built predictive models for snake habit based on their vestibular shape, which estimated D. patagonica and the hypothetical ancestor of crown snakes as burrowers with high probabilities.

The enigmatic organisms that make up these communities are thought to have formed simple ecosystems characterized by a narrow range of feeding modes, with most restricted to the passive absorption of organic particles (osmotrophy). We test between competing feeding models for the iconic Ediacaran organism Tribrachidium heraldicum using computational fluid dynamics. We show that the external morphology of Tribrachidium passively directs water flow toward the apex of the organism and generates low-velocity eddies above apical ""pits."" These patterns of fluid flow are inconsistent with osmotrophy and instead support the interpretation of Tribrachidium as a passive suspension feeder. This finding provides the oldest empirical evidence for suspension feeding at 555 to 550 Ma, ~10 million years before the Cambrian explosion, and demonstrates that Ediacaran organisms formed more complex ecosystems in the latest Precambrian, involving a larger number of ecological guilds, than currently appreciated.']","[]"

We illustrate that lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs) are restriction factors that prevent human cytomegalovirus from establishing latency by removing repressive epigenetic modifications from histones associated with the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP), stimulating the expression of a viral lytic phase target of cell-mediated adaptive immunity.

They bind to kisspeptin receptors with equal efficacy. Kisspeptins and their receptors are expressed by neurons in the arcuate and anteroventral periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Oestrogen mediates negative feedback of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone secretion via the arcuate nucleus. Conversely, it exerts positive feedback via the anteroventral periventricular nucleus. The sexual dimorphism of these nuclei accounts for the differential behaviour of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis between genders. Kisspeptins are essential for reproductive function. Puberty is regulated by the maturation of kisspeptin neurons and by interactions between kisspeptins and leptin. Hence, kisspeptins have potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Kisspeptin agonists may be used to localise lesions in cases of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction and evaluate the gonadotrophic potential of subfertile individuals.

Furthermore, the available elements in the field soils were analyzed to investigate their changes under long-term fertilizer treatment and the ionomic relationships between plant and soil. Maize was cultivated in a field with the following five long-term fertilizer treatments: complete fertilization, fertilization without nitrogen, without phosphorus, without potassium, and no fertilization. Concentrations of 22 elements in leaves at an early flowering stage and in soils after harvest were determined. The fertilizer treatments changed the availabilities of many elements in soils. For example, available cesium was decreased by 39\xa0% and increased by 126\xa0% by fertilizations without nitrogen and potassium, respectively. Effects of treatments on the ionome in leaves were evaluated using the translocation ratio (the concentration in leaves relative to the available concentration in soils) for each element. Nitrogen deficiency specifically increased the uptake ability of molybdenum, which might induce the enhancement of nitrogen assimilation and/or endophytic nitrogen fixation in plant. Potassium deficiency drastically enhanced the uptake ability of various cationic elements. These elements might act as alternatives to K in osmoregulation and counterion of organic/inorganic anions. Two major groups of elements were detected by multivariate analyses of plant ionome. Elements in the same group may be linked more or less in uptake and/or translocation systems.

The reference methodology prescribes a distillation step followed by densimetric measurement. The classic distillation using a Vigreux rectifying column and a West condenser is time consuming and error-prone, especially for liqueurs that may have problems with entrainment and charring. For this reason, this methodology suggests the use of an automated steam distillation device as alternative. The novel instrument comprises an increased steam power, a redesigned geometry of the condenser and a larger cooling coil with controllable flow, compared to previously available devices. Method optimization applying D-optimal and central composite designs showed significant influence of sample volume, distillation time and coolant flow, while other investigated parameters such as steam power, receiver volume, or the use of pipettes or flasks for sample measurement did not significantly influence the results. The method validation was conducted using the following settings: steam power 70\xa0%, sample volume 25\xa0mL transferred using pipettes, receiver volume 50\xa0mL, coolant flow 7 L/min, and distillation time as long as possible just below the calibration mark. For four different liqueurs covering the typical range of these products between 15 and 35\xa0% vol, the method showed an adequate precision, with relative standard deviations below 0.4\xa0% (intraday) and below 0.6\xa0% (interday). The absolute standard deviations were between 0.06\xa0% vol and 0.08\xa0% vol (intraday) and between 0.07\xa0% vol and 0.10\xa0% vol (interday). The improved automatic steam distillation devices offer an excellent alternative for sample cleanup of volatiles from complex matrices. A major advantage are the low costs for consumables per analysis (only distilled water is needed). For alcoholic strength determination, the method has become more rugged than before, and there are only few influences that would lead to incomplete distillation. Our validation parameters have shown that the performance of the method corresponds to the data presented for the reference method and we believe that automated steam distillation, can be used for the purpose of labelling control of alcoholic beverages.']","[]"

Comparisons between the cT and mT-category were performed, as well as the impact on the RT treatment [target volume, doses and hormonal therapy (HT)] independently if it was finally performed. Changes in HT indication for intermediate risk were also analyzed. mpMRI validation was performed with pathological staging (n\xa0=\xa090 patients finally decided to join surgery). The mpMRI upstaging range was 86-94\xa0% for any PSA value or GS. Following mpMRI, 32.8\xa0% of the patients (90/274) were assigned to a different risk group. Compared to cT-category, mpMRI identified more intermediate-risk (46.4 vs. 59.5\xa0%) and high-risk (19.0 vs. 28.8\xa0%) prostate cancer patients. This resulted in a higher indication (p\xa0<\xa00.05) of seminal vesicle irradiation (63.5 vs. 70.0\xa0%), inclusion of any extracapsular disease (T3-T4) within the target volume (1.8 vs. 18.2\xa0%), higher doses (65.3 vs. 88.3\xa0%) and HT associated to RT (45.6 vs. 62.4\xa0%). Global accuracy for mpMRI was higher compared to DRE/TRUS (8.9 vs. 71.1\xa0%, p\xa0<\xa00.05). mpMRI reliability was independent of PSA or GS. mpMRI tumor staging significantly modified the RT treatment decisions in all prostate cancer risk groups.']","[]"

Generally, its mechanism has been interpreted as follows: physical loading, attributed by atmospheric pressure to human bodies, compresses or dilates human blood vessels, which leads to abnormality in blood flow and induces migraine. We report our examination of the stage in which migraine tends to be induced focusing on the variation of atmospheric pressure.', u'RESULTS=Subjects were 34 patients with migraine, who were treated in our hospital. The patients included 31 females and three males, whose mean age was 32\xa0\xb1\xa06.7. 22 patients had migraine with aura and 12 patients had migraine without aura. All of patients with migraine maintained a headache diary to record atmospheric pressures when they developed a migraine. The standard atmospheric pressure was defined as 1013\xa0hPa, and with this value as the criterion, we investigated slight fluctuations in the atmospheric pressure when they developed a migraine. It was found that the atmospheric pressure when the patients developed a migraine was within 1003-1007\xa0hPa in the approach of low atmospheric pressure and that the patients developed a migraine when the atmospheric pressure decreased by 6-10\xa0hPa, slightly less than the standard atmospheric pressure.', u'CONCLUSIONS=Small decreases of 6-10\xa0hPa relative to the standard atmospheric pressure of 1013\xa0hPa induced migraine attacks most frequently in patients with migraine.']","[]"

Different protein extraction methods were tested to find the most robust method to obtain oil palm chromoplast proteins for mass spectrometry analysis. Initially, two different solvents were employed to reduce the fruit lipids. Then, two plant cell wall digestive enzymes were used to acquire the protoplasts to increase the protein extraction effectiveness. A two-stage centrifugation-based fractionation approach enhanced the number of identified proteins, particularly the fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes. The effectiveness of each extraction method was assessed using protein yields and 2DE gel profiles. The ideal method was successfully used to establish the 2DE chromoplast proteome maps of low and high oleic acid mesocarps of oil palm. Further nanoLC-MS/MS analysis of the extracted chromoplast proteins led to the identification of 162 proteins, including some of the main enzymes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis. The established procedures would provide a solid foundation for further functional studies, including fatty acid biosynthetic expression profiling and evaluation of regulatory function.']","[]"

Early expandable prostheses required open surgical procedures to achieve lengthening. Newer prostheses are capable of achieving expansion without open procedures through the use of an electromagnetic field. This study reports our results with 90 consecutive expansion procedures using the Repiphysis(\xae) prosthesis. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 20 patients (22 limbs) who underwent limb-salvage using the Repiphysis(\xae) prosthesis from 2003 to 2015. There were 9 males and 11 females with a mean age of 9\xa0years and 9\xa0months (6-16\xa0years). Reconstruction included the distal femur in 11 cases, total femur in four, proximal tibia in three, proximal humerus in three, and total humerus in one. Complications were reviewed and functional scores were recorded using the MSTS/ISOLS system. Five patients had a second prosthesis implanted during the course of the study for a total of 27 prostheses. The mean follow-up was 57 (6-148)\xa0months. Four patients have not been expanded: three due to death prior to lengthening, and one patient who has not yet developed a leg length discrepancy. Ninety consecutive expansion procedures were performed in 18 limbs in 16 patients. A mean of 9 (5-20)\xa0mm was gained per expansion and 4.8\xa0cm per patient who has undergone expansion to date. Seven patients have reached skeletal maturity and have been converted to an adult endoprosthesis. These patients averaged 8 expansions per patient and a mean of 7.4 (1.8-12.9) cm in length gained. There were 15 complications in 11 patients including one dislocation, one contracture, four cases of aseptic loosening, five structural failures (three expansion mechanism failures and two tibial fractures), three deep infections, and one case of local recurrence. The mean MSTS score was 80\xa0% (37-97\xa0%) and the limb retention rate was 95\xa0%. The results of this study are comparable to previous studies involving non-invasive prostheses.

It offers an opportunity for communities, organizations, risk managers, actuaries and governments to be aware of, and understand fire risks, so that they will increase the direct tackling of the threats posed by fire. Statistical distribution fitting method that best helps identify the stochastic dynamics of fire count data is used. The aim is to provide a fire-prediction model and fire spatial graph for observed fire count data. An empirical probability distribution model is fitted to the fire count data and compared to the theoretical probability distribution of the stochastic process of fire count data. The distribution fitted to the fire frequency count data helps identify the class of models that are exhibited by the fire and provides time leading decisions. The research suggests that fire frequency and loss (fire fatalities) count data in Ghana are best modelled with a Negative Binomial Distribution. The spatial map of observed fire frequency and fatality measured over 5\xa0years (2007-2011) offers in this study a first regional assessment of fire frequency and fire fatality in Ghana.']","[]"

The main transmission vector is the consumption or handling of contaminated chicken meat, since chicken can be colonized asymptomatically by C. jejuni. However, water has been implicated as the transmission vector in a few outbreaks. One possibility is the contamination of water effluent by C. jejuni originating from chicken farm. The ability of C. jejuni to be transmitted by water would be closely associated to its ability to survive in water. Therefore, in this study, we have evaluated the ability of reference strains and chicken-isolated strains to survive in water. Defined water media were used, since the composition of tap water is variable. We showed that some isolates survive better than others in defined freshwater (Fraquil) and that the survival was affected by temperature and the concentration of NaCl. By comparing the ability of C. jejuni to survive in water with other phenotypic properties previously tested, we showed that the ability to survive in water was negatively correlated with autoagglutination. Our data showed that not all chicken isolates have the same ability to survive in water, which is probably due to difference in genetic content.']","[]"

The protective effects of Dex may reportedly be due to the activation of the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR)-dependent cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Spleen has been shown to play a pivotal role in the neural cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. However, little is known about the specific function of spleen in the protective effects of Dex against sepsis. To investigate the role of spleen in the treatment of Dex against sepsis, we studied the effects of preemptive administration of Dex to septic mice on the NF-\u03baB p65 activation and downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the spleen. Our results provided evidence that Dex treatment attenuated LPS-activated NF-\u03baB p65 activation, as well as the production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1\u03b2 at the level of both mRNA and protein in spleen. Consequently, serum concentrations of these cytokines decreased. Conversely, preemptive injection of \u03b1-bungarotoxin, a selective \u03b17nAChR antagonist, reversed these effects of Dex.

Chronic headache was measured with a single item question based on headache frequency. Mental health was assessed by using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). Internal and external coping strategies were assessed through seven options for answering the question: What do you do/what happens when you are burdened by painful thoughts and feelings? Adolescents with chronic headaches showed more frequent mental health problems overall (23\xa0%) compared to those without chronic headache (6\xa0%). Logistic regression analyses showed that those adolescents having both chronic headaches and comorbid mental health problems more frequently used internal coping strategies, such as keeping feelings inside (OR 2.05), using abusive substances (OR 1.79) and talking oneself out of problems (OR 1.55), compared to those without mental health problems. Groups with mental health problems, especially with chronic headache, less frequently used the external strategy of talking to others about their problem than controls (OR 0.7-0.8). Factor analyses revealed significant differences in profiles of coping strategies between groups. We suggest that attention should be paid towards the high risk group that has both chronic headaches and mental health problems and their tendency to use destructive internal coping strategies.']","[]"

Through oligomerization, multiple F-BAR domains can bend membranes into tubules, though the physiological importance of F-BAR-to-F-BAR assemblies is not yet known. Here, we investigate the F-BAR domain of the essential cytokinetic scaffold, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc15, during cytokinesis. Challenging a widely held view that membrane deformation is a fundamental property of F-BARs, we report that the Cdc15 F-BAR binds, but does not deform, membranes in\xa0vivo or in\xa0vitro, and six human\xa0F-BAR domains-including those from Fer and RhoGAP4-share this property. Nevertheless, tip-to-tip interactions between F-BAR dimers are critical for Cdc15 oligomerization and high-avidity membrane binding, stabilization of contractile ring components at the medial cortex, and the fidelity of cytokinesis. F-BAR oligomerization is also critical for Fer and RhoGAP4 physiological function, demonstrating its broad importance to F-BAR proteins that function without membrane bending.']","[]"

Here, we interrogate cytosine methylation patterns in sperm obtained from mice consuming one of three diets, generating whole genome methylation maps for four pools of sperm samples and for 12 individual sperm samples, as well as 61 genome-scale methylation maps. We find that ""epivariation,"" either stochastic or due to unknown demographic or environmental factors, was a far stronger contributor to the\xa0sperm methylome than was the diet consumed. Variation in cytosine methylation was particularly dramatic over tandem repeat families, including ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats, but rDNA methylation was strongly correlated with genetic variation in rDNA copy number and was not influenced by paternal diet.

In low-income countries such as Kenya, there exists a double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and the CVD profile includes many nonatherosclerotic entities. Socio-politico-economic realities present challenges to CVD prevention in Kenya, including poverty, low national spending on health, significant out-of-pocket health expenditures, and limited outpatient health insurance. In addition, the health infrastructure is characterized by insufficient human resources for health, medication stock-outs, and lack of facilities and equipment. Within this socio-politico-economic reality, contextually appropriate programs for CVD prevention need to be developed. We describe our experience from western Kenya, where we have engaged the entire care cascade across all levels of the health system, in order to improve access to high-quality, comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable care for CVD and CVD risk factors. We report on several initiatives: 1) population-wide screening for hypertension and diabetes; 2) engagement of community resources and governance structures; 3) geographic decentralization of care services; 4) task redistribution to more efficiently use of available human resources for health; 5) ensuring a consistent supply of essential medicines; 6) improving physical infrastructure of rural health facilities; 7) developing an integrated health record; and 8) mobile health (mHealth) initiatives to provide clinical decision support and record-keeping functions. Although several challenges remain, there currently exists a critical window of opportunity to establish systems of care and prevention that can alter the trajectory of CVD in low-resource settings.']","[]"

It is also a puzzle of enormous medical importance given the incidence and lethality of gastric cancer worldwide. We review recent findings that have changed how we view these relationships and affected the direction of gastric cancer research. For example, recent data have indicated that subtle mismatches between host and microbe genetic traits greatly affect the risk of gastric cancer. The ability of H pylori and its oncoprotein CagA to reprogram epithelial cells and activate properties of stemness show the sophisticated relationship between H pylori and progenitor cells in the gastric mucosa. The observation that cell-associated H pylori can colonize the gastric glands and directly affect precursor and stem cells supports these observations. The ability to mimic these interactions in human gastric organoid cultures as well as animal models will allow investigators to more fully unravel the extent of H pylori control on the renewing gastric epithelium. Finally, our realization that external environmental factors, such as dietary components and essential micronutrients, as well as the gastrointestinal microbiota, can change the balance between H pylori's activity as a commensal or a pathogen has provided direction to studies aimed at defining the full carcinogenic potential of this organism.""]","[]"

Numerous studies that have examined the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin embedded in a variety of model phospholipid membranes have suggested that partial unfolding of the protein is a precursor to the apoptotic response. However, these studies lacked site resolution and used model systems with negligible or a positive membrane curvature, which is distinct from the large negative curvature of the invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane where cytochrome c resides. We have used reverse micelle encapsulation to mimic the potential effects of confinement on the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin. Encapsulation of oxidized horse cytochrome c in 1-decanoyl-rac-glycerol/lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide/hexanol reverse micelles prepared in pentane yields NMR spectra essentially identical to the protein in free aqueous solution. The structure of encapsulated ferricytochrome c was determined to high precision (<r.m.s. deviation>bb \u223c 0.23 \xc5) using NMR-based methods and is closely similar to the cryogenic crystal structure (<r.m.s. deviation>bb \u223c 1.2 \xc5). Incorporation of cardiolipin into the reverse micelle surfactant shell causes localized chemical shift perturbations of the encapsulated protein, providing the first view of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction interface at atomic resolution. Three distinct sites of interaction are detected: the so-called A- and L-sites, plus a previously undocumented interaction centered on residues Phe-36, Gly-37, Thr-58, Trp-59, and Lys-60. Importantly, in distinct contrast to earlier studies of this interaction, the protein is not significantly disturbed by the binding of cardiolipin in the context of the reverse micelle.']","[]"

Aberrant splicing of TAU exon 10 results in tauopathies characterized by alterations in the proportion of TAU isoforms containing three (3R) or four (4R) microtubule-binding repeats. The splicing factor SC35/SRSF2 binds to nuclear RNA and facilitates the incorporation of exon 10 in the TAU molecule. Here, we utilized clinical samples, an animal model, and neuronal cell cultures and found that Tat promotes TAU 3R up-regulation through increased levels of phosphorylated SC35, which is retained in nuclear speckles. This mechanism involved Tat-mediated increased expression of DYRK1A and was prevented by DYRK1A silencing. In addition, we found that Tat associates with TAU RNA, further demonstrating that Tat interferes with host RNA metabolism in the absence of viral infection. Altogether, our data unravel a novel mechanism of Tat-mediated neuronal toxicity through dysregulation of the SC35-dependent alternative splicing of TAU exon 10. Furthermore, the increased immunostaining of DYRK1A in HIV+ brains without pathology points at dysregulation of DYRK1A as an early event in the neuronal complications of HIV infection.']","[]"

We and others have shown previously that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) improves functional recovery of the rodent heart during reperfusion. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological induction of hyperinsulinemia in mice down-regulates myocardial UCP3. Decreased UCP3 expression was linked to the development of selective insulin resistance in the heart, characterized by decreased basal activity of Akt but preserved activity of the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and overactivation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1-mediated lipogenic program. In cultured myocytes, insulin treatment and SREBP-1 overexpression decreased, whereas SREBP-1 interference increased, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-stimulated expression of UCP3. Promoter deletion and site-directed mutagenesis identified three functional sterol regulatory elements in the vicinity of a known complex intronic enhancer. Increased binding of SREBP-1 to this DNA region was confirmed in the heart of hyperinsulinemic mice. In conclusion, we describe a hitherto unknown regulatory mechanism by which insulin inhibits cardiac UCP3 expression through activation of the lipogenic factor SREBP-1. Sustained down-regulation of cardiac UCP3 by hyperinsulinemia may partly explain the poor prognosis of type 2 diabetic patients after myocardial infarction.']","[]"

Pulmonary substance P and adenosine and their receptors (neurokinin-A receptor, NK1R and ADA1 receptor, ADA1R) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) expressed on PCFs are critical for PCF sensitization and/or activation. Here, we compared substance P and adenosine in BALF and NK1R, ADA1R, and TRPV1 expression in the nodose/jugular (N/J) ganglia (vagal pulmonary C-neurons retrogradely labeled) between Ctrl and PNE pups. We found that PNE failed to change BALF substance P and adenosine content, but significantly upregulated both mRNA and protein TRPV1 and NK1R in the N/J ganglia and only NK1R mRNA in pulmonary C-neurons. To define the role of NK1R in the PNE-induced PCF sensitization, the apneic response to capsaicin (i.v.) without or with pretreatment of SR140333 (a peripheral and selective NK1R antagonist) was compared and the prolonged apnea by PNE significantly shortened by SR140333. To clarify if the PNE-evoked responses depended on action of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly \u03b17nAChR, mecamylamine or methyllycaconitine (a general nAChR or a selective \u03b17nAChR antagonist) was administrated via another mini-pump over the PNE period. Mecamylamine or methyllycaconitine eliminated the PNE-evoked mRNA and protein responses. Our data suggest that PNE is able to elevate PCF NK1R expression via activation of nAChRs, especially \u03b17nAChR, which likely contributes to sensitize PCFs and prolong the PCF-mediated apneic response to capsaicin.']","[]"

Despite advances in this field, the management of acute liver failure continues to be one of the most challenging problems in clinical medicine. The availability of adequate experimental models is of crucial importance to provide a better understanding of this condition and to allow identification of novel drug targets, testing the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions and acting as models for assessing mechanisms of toxicity. Experimental models of hepatotoxicity related to acute liver failure rely on surgical procedures, chemical exposure or viral infection. Each of these models has a number of strengths and weaknesses. This paper specifically reviews commonly used chemical in vivo and in vitro models of hepatotoxicity associated with acute liver failure.']","[]"

Exogenous nucleic acids such as DNA, small interfering RNA, micro RNA, and so on, are used for the purpose of managing expression of the desired therapeutic proteins in ocular tissues. The delivery of unprotected nucleic acids into the cells is limited because of exogenous and endogenous degradation modalities. Nanotechnology, a promising and sophisticated cutting edge tool, works as a protective shelter for these therapeutic nucleic acids. They can be safely delivered to the required cells in order to modulate anticipated protein expression. To this end, nanotechnology is seen as a potential and promising strategy in the field of ocular gene delivery. This review focused on current nanotechnology modalities and other promising nonviral strategies being used to deliver therapeutic genes in order to treat various devastating ocular diseases.
