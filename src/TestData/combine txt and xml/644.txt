TI  - Annotating Logical Forms for EHR Questions.
PG  - 3772-3778
AB  - This paper discusses the creation of a semantically annotated corpus of questions
      about patient data in electronic health records (EHRs). The goal is to provide
      the training data necessary for semantic parsers to automatically convert EHR
      questions into a structured query. A layered annotation strategy is used which
      mirrors a typical natural language processing (NLP) pipeline. First, questions
      are syntactically analyzed to identify multi-part questions. Second, medical
      concepts are recognized and normalized to a clinical ontology. Finally, logical
      forms are created using a lambda calculus representation. We use a corpus of 446 
      questions asking for patient-specific information. From these, 468 specific
      questions are found containing 259 unique medical concepts and requiring 53
      unique predicates to represent the logical forms. We further present detailed
      characteristics of the corpus, including inter-annotator agreement results, and
      describe the challenges automatic NLP systems will face on this task.

TI  - Clinical Word Sense Disambiguation with Interactive Search and Classification.
PG  - 2062-2071
AB  - Resolving word ambiguity in clinical text is critical for many natural language
      processing applications. Effective word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems rely
      on training a machine learning based classifier with abundant clinical text that 
      is accurately annotated, the creation of which can be costly and time-consuming. 
      We describe a double-loop interactive machine learning process, named ReQ-ReC
      (ReQuery-ReClassify), and demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple evaluation
      corpora. Using ReQ-ReC, a human expert first uses her domain knowledge to include
      sense-specific contextual words into the ReQuery loops and searches for instances
      relevant to the senses. Then, in the ReClassify loops, the expert only annotates 
      the most ambiguous instances found by the current WSD model. Even with
      machine-generated queries only, the framework is comparable with or faster than
      current active learning methods in building WSD models. The process can be
      further accelerated when human experts use their domain knowledge to guide the
      search process.

TI  - Ensembles of NLP Tools for Data Element Extraction from Clinical Notes.
PG  - 1880-1889
AB  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) is essential for concept extraction from
      narrative text in electronic health records (EHR). To extract numerous and
      diverse concepts, such as data elements (i.e., important concepts related to a
      certain medical condition), a plausible solution is to combine various NLP tools 
      into an ensemble to improve extraction performance. However, it is unclear to
      what extent ensembles of popular NLP tools improve the extraction of numerous and
      diverse concepts. Therefore, we built an NLP ensemble pipeline to synergize the
      strength of popular NLP tools using seven ensemble methods, and to quantify the
      improvement in performance achieved by ensembles in the extraction of data
      elements for three very different cohorts. Evaluation results show that the
      pipeline can improve the performance of NLP tools, but there is high variability 
      depending on the cohort.

TI  - Differentiating Sense through Semantic Interaction Data.
PG  - 1238-1247
AB  - Words which have different representations but are semantically related, such as 
      dementia and delirium, can pose difficult issues in understanding text. We
      explore the use of interaction frequency data between semantic elements as a
      means to differentiate concept pairs, using semantic predications extracted from 
      the biomedical literature. We applied datasets of features drawn from semantic
      predications for semantically related pairs to two Expectation Maximization
      clustering processes (without, and with concept labels), then used all data to
      train and evaluate several concept classifying algorithms. For the unlabeled
      datasets, 80% displayed expected cluster count and similar or matching
      proportions; all labeled data exhibited similar or matching proportions when
      restricting cluster count to unique labels. The highest performing classifier
      achieved 89% accuracy, with F1 scores for individual concept classification
      ranging from 0.69 to 1. We conclude with a discussion on how these findings may
      be applied to natural language processing of clinical text.

TI  - Investigating Longitudinal Tobacco Use Information from Social History and
      Clinical Notes in the Electronic Health Record.
PG  - 1209-1218
AB  - The electronic health record (EHR) provides an opportunity for improved use of
      clinical documentation including leveraging tobacco use information by clinicians
      and researchers. In this study, we investigated the content, consistency, and
      completeness of tobacco use data from structured and unstructured sources in the 
      EHR. A natural language process (NLP) pipeline was utilized to extract details
      about tobacco use from clinical notes and free-text tobacco use comments within
      the social history module of an EHR system. We analyzed the consistency of
      tobacco use information within clinical notes, comments, and available structured
      fields for tobacco use. Our results indicate that structured fields for tobacco
      use alone may not be able to provide complete tobacco use information. While
      there was better consistency for some elements (e.g., status and type),
      inconsistencies were found particularly for temporal information. Further work is
      needed to improve tobacco use information integration from different parts of the
      EHR.

TI  - Using Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis to Develop a Conceptual
      Framework for Medication Therapy Management Research.
PG  - 984-993
AB  - This paper describes a theory derivation process used to develop a conceptual
      framework for medication therapy management (MTM) research. The MTM service model
      and chronic care model were selected as parent theories. Review article abstracts
      targeting medication therapy management in chronic disease care were retrieved
      from Ovid Medline (2000-2016). Unique concepts in each abstract were extracted
      using MetaMap and their pairwise cooccurrence determined. The information was
      used to construct a network graph of concept co-occurrence that was analyzed to
      identify content for the new conceptual model. 142 abstracts were analyzed.
      Medication adherence is the most studied drug therapy problem and co-occurred
      with concepts related to patient-centered interventions targeting
      self-management. The enhanced model consists of 65 concepts clustered into 14
      constructs. The framework requires additional refinement and evaluation to
      determine its relevance and applicability across a broad audience including
      underserved settings.

TI  - Towards Comprehensive Clinical Abbreviation Disambiguation Using Machine-Labeled 
      Training Data.
PG  - 560-569
AB  - Abbreviation disambiguation in clinical texts is a problem handled well by fully 
      supervised machine learning methods. Acquiring training data, however, is
      expensive and would be impractical for large numbers of abbreviations in
      specialized corpora. An alternative is a semi-supervised approach, in which
      training data are automatically generated by substituting long forms in natural
      text with their corresponding abbreviations. Most prior implementations of this
      method either focus on very few abbreviations or do not test on real-world data. 
      We present a realistic use case by testing several semi-supervised classification
      algorithms on a large hand-annotated medical record of occurrences of 74
      ambiguous abbreviations. Despite notable differences between training and test
      corpora, classifiers achieve up to 90% accuracy. Our tests demonstrate that
      semi-supervised abbreviation disambiguation is a viable and extensible option for
      medical NLP systems.

PG  - 524-533
AB  - Important information is encoded in free-text patient comments. We determine the 
      most common topics in patient comments, design automatic topic classifiers,
      identify comments ' sentiment, and find new topics in negative comments. Our
      annotation scheme consisted of 28 topics, with positive and negative sentiment.
      Within those 28 topics, the seven most frequent accounted for 63% of annotations.
      For automated topic classification, we developed vocabulary-based and Naive Bayes
      ' classifiers. For sentiment analysis, another Naive Bayes ' classifier was used.
      Finally, we used topic modeling to search for unexpected topics within negative
      comments. The seven most common topics were appointment access, appointment wait,
      empathy, explanation, friendliness, practice environment, and overall experience.
      The best F-measures from our classifier were 0.52(NB), 0.57(NB), 0.36(Vocab),
      0.74(NB), 0.40(NB), and 0.44(Vocab), respectively. F- scores ranged from 0.16 to 
      0.74. The sentiment classification F-score was 0.84. Negative comment topic
      modeling revealed complaints about appointment access, appointment wait, and time
      spent with physician.

TI  - Automated Detection of Privacy Sensitive Conditions in C-CDAs: Security Labeling 
      Services at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
PG  - 332-341
AB  - Care coordination across healthcare organizations depends upon health information
      exchange. Various policies and laws govern permissible exchange, particularly
      when the information includes privacy sensitive conditions. The Department of
      Veterans Affairs (VA) privacy policy has required either blanket consent or
      manual sensitivity review prior to exchanging any health information. The VA
      experience has been an expensive, administratively demanding burden on staffand
      Veterans alike, particularly for patients without privacy sensitive conditions.
      Until recently, automatic sensitivity determination has not been feasible. This
      paper proposes a policy-driven algorithmic approach (Security Labeling Service or
      SLS) to health information exchange that automatically detects the presence or
      absence of specific privacy sensitive conditions and then, to only require a
      Veteran signed consent for release when actually present. The SLS was applied
      successfully to a sample of real patient Consolidated-Clinical Document
      Architecture(C-CDA) documents. The SLS identified standard terminology codes by
      both parsing structured entries and analyzing textual information using Natural
      Language Processing (NLP).

PG  - 2602-2605
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591263 [doi]
AB  - Deep learning has achieved remarkable results in the areas of computer vision,
      speech recognition, natural language processing and most recently, even playing
      Go. The application of deep-learning to problems in healthcare, however, has
      gained attention only in recent years, and it's ultimate place at the bedside
      remains a topic of skeptical discussion. While there is a growing academic
      interest in the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to clinical
      problems, many in the clinical community see little incentive to upgrade from
      simpler methods, such as logistic regression, to deep learning. Logistic
      regression, after all, provides odds ratios, p-values and confidence intervals
      that allow for ease of interpretation, while deep nets are often seen as
      `black-boxes' which are difficult to understand and, as of yet, have not
      demonstrated performance levels far exceeding their simpler counterparts. If deep
      learning is to ever take a place at the bedside, it will require studies which
      (1) showcase the performance of deep-learning methods relative to other
      approaches and (2) interpret the relationships between network structure, model
      performance, features and outcomes. We have chosen these two requirements as the 
      goal of this study. In our investigation, we utilized a publicly available EMR
      dataset of over 32,000 intensive care unit patients and trained a Deep Belief
      Network (DBN) to predict patient mortality at discharge. Utilizing an
      evolutionary algorithm, we demonstrate automated topology selection for DBNs. We 
      demonstrate that with the correct topology selection, DBNs can achieve better
      prediction performance compared to several bench-marking methods.

AB  - This paper presents a data-driven approach to graphically presenting text-based
      patient journals while still maintaining all textual information. The system
      first creates a timeline representation of a patients' physiological condition
      during an admission, which is assessed by electronically monitoring vital signs
      and then combining these into Early Warning Scores (EWS). Hereafter, techniques
      from Natural Language Processing (NLP) are applied on the existing patient
      journal to extract all entries. Finally, the two methods are combined into an
      interactive timeline featuring the ability to see drastic changes in the
      patients' health, and thereby enabling staff to see where in the journal critical
      events have taken place.

TI  - S2NI: a mobile platform for nutrition monitoring from spoken data.
PG  - 1991-1994
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591115 [doi]
AB  - Diet and physical activity are important lifestyle and behavioral factors in
      self-management and prevention of many chronic diseases. Mobile sensors such as
      accelerometers have been used in the past to objectively measure physical
      activity or detect eating time. Diet monitoring, however, still relies on
      self-recorded data by end users where individuals use mobile devices for
      recording nutrition intake by either entering text or taking images. Such
      approaches have shown low adherence in technology adoption and achieve only
      moderate accuracy. In this paper, we propose development and validation of
      Speech-to-Nutrient-Information (S2NI), a comprehensive nutrition monitoring
      system that combines speech processing, natural language processing, and text
      mining in a unified platform to extract nutrient information such as calorie
      intake from spoken data. After converting the voice data to text, we identify
      food name and portion size information within the text. We then develop a tiered 
      matching algorithm to search the food name in our nutrition database and to
      accurately compute calorie intake. Due to its pervasive nature and ease of use,
      S2NI enables users to report their diet routine more frequently and at anytime
      through their smartphone. We evaluate S2NI using real data collected with 10
      participants. Our experimental results show that S2NI achieves 80.6% accuracy in 
      computing calorie intake.

TI  - Detecting negation and scope in Chinese clinical notes using character and word
      embedding.
PG  - 53-59
LID - S0169-2607(16)30838-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.11.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Researchers have developed effective methods to index 
      free-text clinical notes into structured database, in which negation detection is
      a critical but challenging step. In Chinese clinical records, negation detection 
      is particularly challenging because it may depend on upstream Chinese information
      processing components such as word segmentation [1]. Traditionally, negation
      detection was carried out mostly using rule-based methods, whose
      comprehensiveness and portability were usually limited. Our objectives in this
      paper are to: 1) Construct a large Chinese clinical notes corpus with negation
      annotated; 2) develop a negation detection tool for Chinese clinical notes; 3)
      evaluate the performance of character and word embedding features in Chinese
      clinical natural language processing. METHODS: In this paper, we construct a
      Chinese clinical corpus consisting of admission and discharge summaries, and
      propose sequence labeling based systems for negation and scope detection. Our
      systems rely on features from bag of characters, bag of words, character
      embedding and word embedding. For scopes, we introduce an additional feature to
      handle nested scopes with multiple negations. RESULTS: The two annotators reached
      an agreement of 0.79 measured by Kappa in manual annotation. In cue detection,
      our systems are able to achieve a performance as high as 99.0% measured by F
      score, which significantly outperform its rule-based counterpart (79% F). The
      best system uses word embedding as features, which yields precision of 99.0% and 
      recall of 99.1%. In scope detection, our system is able to achieve a performance 
      of 94.6% measured by F score. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a state-of-the-art 
      negation-detecting tool for Chinese clinical free-text notes; Experimental
      results demonstrate that word embedding is effective in identifying negations,
      and that nested scopes can be identified effectively by our method.

TI  - Optic Disc and Macular Imaging in Blind Eyes from Non-glaucomatous Optic
      Neuropathy: A Study with Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/01658107.2016.1238487 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the optic disc and macular
      thickness measurements using two spectral-domain optical coherence tomography
      (SD-OCT) instruments in long-standing blind eyes diagnosed with non-glaucomatous 
      optic neuropathies (NGON). A prospective observational case-series design was
      used. Twelve eyes from 12 NGON patients with no light perception for at least 6
      months underwent optic disc and macular imaging with Cirrus HD-OCT and Spectralis
      OCT. The correlation between the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (PRNFL) 
      and macular ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer (GCL+IPL) thicknesses, 
      and between the duration of no light perception (NLP) and PRNFL/GCL+IPL
      thicknesses were determined using Spearman's correlation analysis. The mean
      average PRNFL thickness was 55.9 +/- 4.8 microm for Cirrus HD-OCT, which was
      significantly thicker than that measured by Spectralis OCT (31.9 +/- 7.4 microm; 
      p < 0.001). The mean central macular thickness on Cirrus HD-OCT was normal, but
      there was global thinning at the other macular areas. The mean average GCL+IPL
      thickness on Cirrus HD-OCT was 51.8 +/- 5.8 microm. There was a good correlation 
      between average PRNFL thickness and GCL+IPL thickness (r = 0.830, p = 0.002);
      however, there was no significant correlation between the duration of NLP to the 
      average PRNFL thickness (on either instruments) or GCL+IPL thickness on Cirrus
      HD-OCT (p > 0.7). These results show that there was residual PRNFL thickness in
      NGON eyes with NLP, which varied significantly between SD-OCT instruments. The
      values of the residual PRNFL and GCL+IPL thicknesses in blind eyes (the "floor"
      effect) may be useful for prognostic purposes for patients with partial optic
      atrophy.

TI  - Assessing Quality of Care and Elder Abuse in Nursing Homes via Google Reviews.
PG  - e201
LID - 10.5210/ojphi.v8i3.6906 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is challenging to assess the quality of care and detect elder
      abuse in nursing homes, since patients may be incapable of reporting quality
      issues or abuse themselves, and resources for sending inspectors are limited.
      OBJECTIVE: This study correlates Google reviews of nursing homes with Centers for
      Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) inspection results in the Nursing Home
      Compare (NHC) data set, to quantify the extent to which the reviews reflect the
      quality of care and the presence of elder abuse. METHODS: A total of 16,160
      reviews were collected, spanning 7,170 nursing homes. Two approaches were tested:
      using the average rating as an overall estimate of the quality of care at a
      nursing home, and using the average scores from a maximum entropy classifier
      trained to recognize indications of elder abuse. RESULTS: The classifier achieved
      an F-measure of 0.81, with precision 0.74 and recall 0.89. The correlation for
      the classifier is weak but statistically significant: = 0.13, P < .001, and 95%
      confidence interval (0.10, 0.16). The correlation for the ratings exhibits a
      slightly higher correlation: = 0.15, P < .001. Both the classifier and rating
      correlations approach approximately 0.65 when the effective average number of
      reviews per provider is increased by aggregating similar providers. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results indicate that an analysis of Google reviews of nursing homes can be
      used to detect indications of elder abuse with high precision and to assess the
      quality of care, but only when a sufficient number of reviews are available.

TI  - Twitter Influenza Surveillance: Quantifying Seasonal Misdiagnosis Patterns and
      their Impact on Surveillance Estimates.
PG  - e198
LID - 10.5210/ojphi.v8i3.7011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Influenza (flu) surveillance using Twitter data can potentially save 
      lives and increase efficiency by providing governments and healthcare
      organizations with greater situational awareness. However, research is needed to 
      determine the impact of Twitter users' misdiagnoses on surveillance estimates.
      OBJECTIVE: This study establishes the importance of Twitter users' misdiagnoses
      by showing that Twitter flu surveillance in the United States failed during the
      2011-2012 flu season, estimates the extent of misdiagnoses, and tests several
      methods for reducing the adverse effects of misdiagnoses. METHODS: Metrics
      representing flu prevalence, seasonal misdiagnosis patterns, diagnosis
      uncertainty, flu symptoms, and noise were produced using Twitter data in
      conjunction with OpenSextant for geo-inferencing, and a maximum entropy
      classifier for identifying tweets related to illness. These metrics were tested
      for correlations with World Health Organization (WHO) positive specimen counts of
      flu from 2011 to 2014. RESULTS: Twitter flu surveillance erroneously indicated a 
      typical flu season during 2011-2012, even though the flu season peaked three
      months late, and erroneously indicated plateaus of flu tweets before the
      2012-2013 and 2013-2014 flu seasons. Enhancements based on estimates of
      misdiagnoses removed the erroneous plateaus and increased the Pearson correlation
      coefficients by .04 and .23, but failed to correct the 2011-2012 flu season
      estimate. A rough estimate indicates that approximately 40% of flu tweets
      reflected misdiagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Further research into factors affecting
      Twitter users' misdiagnoses, in conjunction with data from additional atypical
      flu seasons, is needed to enable Twitter flu surveillance systems to produce
      reliable estimates during atypical flu seasons.

TI  - Identifying the missing proteins in human proteome by biological language model.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/s12918-016-0352-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, 
      the proteomics research becomes a trendy field in the post genomics era. It is
      necessary to identify all the native-encoding protein sequences for further
      function and pathway analysis. Toward that end, the Human Proteome Organization
      lunched the Human Protein Project in 2011. However many proteins are hard to be
      detected by experiment methods, which becomes one of the bottleneck in Human
      Proteome Project. In consideration of the complicatedness of detecting these
      missing proteins by using wet-experiment approach, here we use bioinformatics
      method to pre-filter the missing proteins. RESULTS: Since there are analogy
      between the biological sequences and natural language, the n-gram models from
      Natural Language Processing field has been used to filter the missing proteins.
      The dataset used in this study contains 616 missing proteins from the "uncertain"
      category of the neXtProt database. There are 102 proteins deduced by the n-gram
      model, which have high probability to be native human proteins. We perform a
      detail analysis on the predicted structure and function of these missing proteins
      and also compare the high probability proteins with other mass spectrum datasets.
      The evaluation shows that the results reported here are in good agreement with
      those obtained by other well-established databases. CONCLUSION: The analysis
      shows that 102 proteins may be native gene-coding proteins and some of the
      missing proteins are membrane or natively disordered proteins which are hard to
      be detected by experiment methods.

AB  - Water consumption required during the leaching stage in the surimi manufacturing 
      process strongly depends on the design and the number and size of stages
      connected in series for the soluble protein extraction target, and it is
      considered as the main contributor to the operating costs. Therefore, the optimal
      synthesis and design of the leaching stage is essential to minimize the total
      annual cost. In this study, a mathematical optimization model for the optimal
      design of the leaching operation is presented. Precisely, a detailed Mixed
      Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model including operating and geometric
      constraints was developed based on our previous optimization model (NLP model).
      Aspects about quality, water consumption and main operating parameters were
      considered. The minimization of total annual costs, which considered a trade-off 
      between investment and operating costs, led to an optimal solution with lesser
      number of stages (2 instead of 3 stages) and higher volumes of the leaching tanks
      comparing with previous results. An analysis was performed in order to
      investigate how the optimal solution was influenced by the variations of the
      unitary cost of fresh water, waste treatment and capital investment.

TI  - Cross-Domain Recognition by Identifying Joint Subspaces of Source Domain and
      Target Domain.
LID - 10.1109/TCYB.2016.2538199 [doi]
AB  - This paper introduces a new method to solve the cross-domain recognition problem.
      Different from the traditional domain adaption methods which rely on a global
      domain shift for all classes between the source and target domains, the proposed 
      method is more flexible to capture individual class variations across domains. By
      adopting a natural and widely used assumption that the data samples from the same
      class should lay on an intrinsic low-dimensional subspace, even if they come from
      different domains, the proposed method circumvents the limitation of the global
      domain shift, and solves the cross-domain recognition by finding the joint
      subspaces of the source and target domains. Specifically, given labeled samples
      in the source domain, we construct a subspace for each of the classes. Then we
      construct subspaces in the target domain, called anchor subspaces, by collecting 
      unlabeled samples that are close to each other and are highly likely to belong to
      the same class. The corresponding class label is then assigned by minimizing a
      cost function which reflects the overlap and topological structure consistency
      between subspaces across the source and target domains, and within the anchor
      subspaces, respectively. We further combine the anchor subspaces to the
      corresponding source subspaces to construct the joint subspaces. Subsequently,
      one-versus-rest support vector machine classifiers are trained using the data
      samples belonging to the same joint subspaces and applied to unlabeled data in
      the target domain. We evaluate the proposed method on two widely used datasets:
      1) object recognition dataset for computer vision tasks and 2) sentiment
      classification dataset for natural language processing tasks. Comparison results 
      demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparison methods on both
      datasets.

      of Clinical Notes.
PG  - 126-131
LID - 10.1109/BHI.2016.7455851 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a chronic disease that affects millions of
      people worldwide. Ascertaining PAD status from clinical notes by manual chart
      review is labor intensive and time consuming. In this paper, we describe a
      natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for automated ascertainment of PAD
      status from clinical notes using predetermined criteria. We developed and
      evaluated our system against a gold standard that was created by medical experts 
      based on manual chart review. Our system ascertained PAD status from clinical
      notes with high sensitivity (0.96), positive predictive value (0.92), negative
      predictive value (0.99) and specificity (0.98). NLP approaches can be used for
      rapid, efficient and automated ascertainment of PAD cases with implications for
      patient care and epidemiologic research.

TI  - Development of medical treatment for eye injuries in the mainland of China over
      the past decade.
PG  - 311-316
AB  - In the article, the development of medical treatment for eye injuries in the
      mainland of China was reviewed. According to the data provided in Eye Injury
      Vitrectomy Study (EIVS), 27% of 72 eyes with no light perception (NLP) gained
      recovery in term of antomy and visual function. Vitrectomy initiated at more than
      4 weeks after open eye injury is an independent risk factor for developing PVR.
      Prognosis of anatomy and visual function of the injured eye with PVR is markedly 
      worse than that without PVR. Serious injuries of ciliary body, choroid and retina
      are three key parts of the eye with NLP. The concept that the treatment of the
      eye injury gradually focus on the whole globe is embodied. The data from 13575 in
      patients with traumatic eyes in 14 hospitals revealed that the rate of immediate 
      enucleation was remarkable reduced with comparison of 20 years ago.

LID - 10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2587640 [doi]
AB  - Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in
      artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language
      processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep
      recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and
      machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing
      an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target
      description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets
      show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely
      from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both 
      qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, given the recent surge of interest in 
      this task, a competition was organized in 2015 using the newly released COCO
      dataset. We describe and analyze the various improvements we applied to our own
      baseline and show the resulting performance in the competition, which we won
      ex-aequo with a team from Microsoft Research.

LID - 10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2511748 [doi]
AB  - Finding an informative subset of a large collection of data points or models is
      at the center of many problems in computer vision, recommender systems,
      bio/health informatics as well as image and natural language processing. Given
      pairwise dissimilarities between the elements of a 'source set' and a 'target
      set,' we consider the problem of finding a subset of the source set, called
      representatives or exemplars, that can efficiently describe the target set. We
      formulate the problem as a row-sparsity regularized trace minimization problem.
      Since the proposed formulation is, in general, NP-hard, we consider a convex
      relaxation. The solution of our optimization finds representatives and the
      assignment of each element of the target set to each representative, hence,
      obtaining a clustering. We analyze the solution of our proposed optimization as a
      function of the regularization parameter. We show that when the two sets jointly 
      partition into multiple groups, our algorithm finds representatives from all
      groups and reveals clustering of the sets. In addition, we show that the proposed
      framework can effectively deal with outliers. Our algorithm works with arbitrary 
      dissimilarities, which can be asymmetric or violate the triangle inequality. To
      efficiently implement our algorithm, we consider an Alternating Direction Method 
      of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, which results in quadratic complexity in the
      problem size. We show that the ADMM implementation allows to parallelize the
      algorithm, hence further reducing the computational time. Finally, by experiments
      on real-world datasets, we show that our proposed algorithm improves the state of
      the art on the two problems of scene categorization using representative images
      and time-series modeling and segmentation using representative models.

AB  - An improvement of the penetration efficiency combined with the controlled release
      of actives in the skin can facilitate the medical treatment of skin diseases
      immensely. Dexamethasone (Dx), a synthetic glucocorticoid, is frequently used for
      the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. To investigate the penetration of
      nano-sized lipid particles (NLP) loaded with Dx in comparison to a commercially
      available base cream, different techniques were applied. Electron paramagnetic
      resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to monitor the penetration of Dx, which was
      covalently labeled with the spin probe
      3-(Carboxy)-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (PCA). The penetration into
      hair follicles was studied using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with
      curcumin-loaded NLP. The penetration of the vehicle was followed by confocal
      Raman microscopy (CRM). Penetration studies using excised porcine skin revealed a
      more than twofold higher penetration efficiency for DxPCA into the stratum
      corneum (SC) after 24h incubation compared to 4h incubation when loaded to the
      NLP, whereas when applied in the base cream, almost no further penetration was
      observed beyond 4h. The distribution of DxPCA within the SC was investigated by
      consecutive tape stripping. The release of DxPCA from the base cream after 24h in
      deeper SC layers and the viable epidermis was shown by EPR. For NLP, no release
      from the carrier was observed, although DxPCA was detectable in the skin after
      the complete SC was removed. This phenomenon can be explained by the penetration 
      of the NLP into the hair follicles. However, penetration profiles measured by CRM
      indicate that NLP did not penetrate as deeply into the SC as the base cream
      formulation. In conclusion, NLP can improve the accumulation of Dx in the skin
      and provide a reservoir within the SC and in the follicular infundibula.

TI  - Enhancing Risk Assessment in Patients Receiving Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy 
      Using Natural Language Processing.
LID - pnw283 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnw283 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical guidelines for the use of opioids in chronic noncancer pain 
      recommend assessing risk for aberrant drug-related behaviors prior to initiating 
      opioid therapy. Despite recent dramatic increases in prescription opioid misuse
      and abuse, use of screening tools by clinicians continues to be underutilized.
      This research evaluated natural language processing (NLP) together with other
      data extraction techniques for risk assessment of patients considered for opioid 
      therapy as a means of predicting opioid abuse. DESIGN: Using a retrospective
      cohort of 3,668 chronic noncancer pain patients with at least one opioid
      agreement between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012, we examined the
      availability of electronic health record structured and unstructured data to
      populate the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) and other selected outcomes.
      Clinician-documented opioid agreement violations in the clinical notes were
      determined using NLP techniques followed by manual review of the notes. RESULTS: 
      Confirmed through manual review, the NLP algorithm had 96.1% sensitivity, 92.8%
      specificity, and 92.6% positive predictive value in identifying opioid agreement 
      violation. At the time of most recent opioid agreement, automated ORT identified 
      42.8% of patients as at low risk, 28.2% as at moderate risk, and 29.0% as at high
      risk for opioid abuse. During a year following the agreement, 22.5% of patients
      had opioid agreement violations. Patients classified as high risk were three
      times more likely to violate opioid agreements compared with those with
      low/moderate risk. CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that NLP techniques have
      potential utility to support clinicians in screening chronic noncancer pain
      patients considered for long-term opioid therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite extensive efforts to monitor and prevent surgical site
      infections (SSIs), real-time surveillance of clinical practice has been sparse
      and expensive or nonexistent. However, natural language processing (NLP) and
      machine learning (i.e., Bayesian network analysis) may provide the methodology
      necessary to approach this issue in a new way. We investigated the ability to
      identify SSIs after colorectal surgery (CRS) through an automated detection
      system using a Bayesian network. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent
      CRS from 2010 to 2012 and were captured in our institutional American College of 
      Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) comprised our 
      cohort. A Bayesian network was applied to detect SSIs using risk factors from
      ACS-NSQIP data and keywords extracted from clinical notes by NLP. Two surgeons
      provided expertise informing the Bayesian network to identify clinically
      meaningful SSIs (CM-SSIs) occurring within 30 d after surgery. RESULTS: We used
      data from 751 CRS cases experiencing 67 (8.9%) SSIs and 78 (10.4%) CM-SSIs. Our
      Bayesian network detected ACS-NSQIP-captured SSIs with a receiver operating
      characteristic area under the curve of 0.827, but this value increased to 0.892
      when using surgeon-identified CM-SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: A Bayesian network coupled
      with NLP has the potential to be used in real-time SSI surveillance. Moreover,
      surgeons identified CM-SSI not captured under current NSQIP definitions. Future
      efforts to expand CM-SSI identification may lead to improved and potentially
      automated approaches to survey for postoperative SSI in clinical practice.

AB  - Nitrate modulates growth and development, functioning as a nutrient signal in
      plants. Although many changes in physiological processes in response to nitrate
      have been well characterized as nitrate responses, the molecular mechanisms
      underlying the nitrate response are not yet fully understood. Here, we show that 
      NLP transcription factors, which are key regulators of the nitrate response,
      directly activate the nitrate-inducible expression of BT1 and BT2 encoding
      putative scaffold proteins with a plant-specific domain structure in Arabidopsis.
      Interestingly, the 35S promoter-driven expression of BT2 partially rescued growth
      inhibition caused by reductions in NLP activity in Arabidopsis. Furthermore,
      simultaneous disruption of BT1 and BT2 affected nitrate-dependent lateral root
      development. These results suggest that direct activation of BT1 and BT2 by NLP
      transcriptional activators is a key component of the molecular mechanism
      underlying the nitrate response in Arabidopsis.

PG  - e0168843
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0168843 [doi]
AB  - An impressive breadth of interdisciplinary research suggests that emotions have
      an influence on human behavior. Nonetheless, we still know very little about the 
      emotional states of those actors whose daily decisions have a lasting impact on
      our societies: politicians in parliament. We address this question by making use 
      of methods of natural language processing and a digitized corpus of text data
      spanning a century of parliamentary debates in the United Kingdom. We use this
      approach to examine changes in aggregate levels of emotional polarity in the
      British parliament, and to test a hypothesis about the emotional response of
      politicians to economic recessions. Our findings suggest that, contrary to
      popular belief, the mood of politicians has become more positive during the past 
      decades, and that variations in emotional polarity can be predicted by the state 
      of the national economy.

TI  - Building an Evaluation Scale using Item Response Theory.
PG  - 648-657
AB  - Evaluation of NLP methods requires testing against a previously vetted
      gold-standard test set and reporting standard metrics
      (accuracy/precision/recall/F1). The current assumption is that all items in a
      given test set are equal with regards to difficulty and discriminating power. We 
      propose Item Response Theory (IRT) from psychometrics as an alternative means for
      gold-standard test-set generation and NLP system evaluation. IRT is able to
      describe characteristics of individual items - their difficulty and
      discriminating power - and can account for these characteristics in its
      estimation of human intelligence or ability for an NLP task. In this paper, we
      demonstrate IRT by generating a gold-standard test set for Recognizing Textual
      Entailment. By collecting a large number of human responses and fitting our IRT
      model, we show that our IRT model compares NLP systems with the performance in a 
      human population and is able to provide more insight into system performance than
      standard evaluation metrics. We show that a high accuracy score does not always
      imply a high IRT score, which depends on the item characteristics and the
      response pattern.

TI  - Algorithmic Classification of Five Characteristic Types of Paraphasias.
PG  - S776-S787
LID - 10.1044/2016_AJSLP-15-0147 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study was intended to evaluate a series of algorithms developed to 
      perform automatic classification of paraphasic errors (formal, semantic, mixed,
      neologistic, and unrelated errors). Method: We analyzed 7,111 paraphasias from
      the Moss Aphasia Psycholinguistics Project Database (Mirman et al., 2010) and
      evaluated the classification accuracy of 3 automated tools. First, we used
      frequency norms from the SUBTLEXus database (Brysbaert & New, 2009) to
      differentiate nonword errors and real-word productions. Then we implemented a
      phonological-similarity algorithm to identify phonologically related real-word
      errors. Last, we assessed the performance of a semantic-similarity criterion that
      was based on word2vec (Mikolov, Yih, & Zweig, 2013). Results: Overall, the
      algorithmic classification replicated human scoring for the major categories of
      paraphasias studied with high accuracy. The tool that was based on the SUBTLEXus 
      frequency norms was more than 97% accurate in making lexicality judgments. The
      phonological-similarity criterion was approximately 91% accurate, and the overall
      classification accuracy of the semantic classifier ranged from 86% to 90%.
      Conclusion: Overall, the results highlight the potential of tools from the field 
      of natural language processing for the development of highly reliable,
      cost-effective diagnostic tools suitable for collecting high-quality measurement 
      data for research and clinical purposes.

TI  - The utility of including pathology reports in improving the computational
      identification of patients.
PG  - 46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder. Efficient
      identification of patients may improve chronic management of the disease. Prior
      studies have shown searching International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9)
      codes alone is inaccurate for identifying patients with CD. In this study, we
      developed automated classification algorithms leveraging pathology reports and
      other clinical data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to refine the subset
      population preselected using ICD-9 code (579.0). MATERIALS AND METHODS: EHRs were
      searched for established ICD-9 code (579.0) suggesting CD, based on which an
      initial identification of cases was obtained. In addition, laboratory results for
      tissue transglutaminse were extracted. Using natural language processing we
      analyzed pathology reports from upper endoscopy. Twelve machine learning
      classifiers using different combinations of variables related to ICD-9 CD status,
      laboratory result status, and pathology reports were experimented to find the
      best possible CD classifier. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to assess the
      results. RESULTS: A total of 1498 patient records were used including 363
      confirmed cases and 1135 false positive cases that served as controls. Logistic
      model based on both clinical and pathology report features produced the best
      results: Kappa of 0.78, F1 of 0.92, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94,
      whereas in contrast using ICD-9 only generated poor results: Kappa of 0.28, F1 of
      0.75, and AUC of 0.63. CONCLUSION: Our automated classification system presented 
      an efficient and reliable way to improve the performance of CD patient
      identification.

TI  - Classical Challenges in the Physical Chemistry of Polymer Networks and the Design
      of New Materials.
PG  - 2786-2795
AB  - Polymer networks are widely used from commodity to biomedical materials. The
      space-spanning, net-like structure gives polymer networks their advantageous
      mechanical and dynamic properties, the most essential factor that governs their
      responses to external electrical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. Despite the
      ubiquity of applications and a century of active research on these materials, the
      way that chemistry and processing interact to yield the final structure and the
      material properties of polymer networks is not fully understood, which leads to a
      number of classical challenges in the physical chemistry of gels. Fundamentally, 
      it is not yet possible to quantitatively predict the mechanical response of a
      polymer network based on its chemical design, limiting our ability to understand 
      and characterize the nanostructure of gels and rationally design new materials.
      In this Account, we summarize our recent theoretical and experimental approaches 
      to study the physical chemistry of polymer networks. First, our understanding of 
      the impact of molecular defects on topology and elasticity of polymer networks is
      discussed. By systematically incorporating the effects of different orders of
      loop structure, we develop a kinetic graph theory and real elastic network theory
      that bridge the chemical design, the network topology, and the mechanical
      properties of the gel. These theories show good agreement with the recent
      experimental data without any fitting parameters. Next, associative polymer gel
      dynamics is discussed, focusing on our evolving understanding of the effect of
      transient bonds on the mechanical response. Using forced Rayleigh scattering
      (FRS), we are able to probe diffusivity across a wide range of length and time
      scales in gels. A superdiffusive region is observed in different associative
      network systems, which can be captured by a two-state kinetic model. Further, the
      effects of the architecture and chemistry of polymer chains on gel nanostructure 
      are studied. By incorporating shear-thinning coiled-coil protein motifs into the 
      midblock of a micelle-forming block copolymer, we are able to responsively adjust
      the gel toughness through controlling the nanostructure. Finally, we review the
      development of novel application-oriented materials that emerge from our enhanced
      understanding of gel physical chemistry, including injectable gel hemostats
      designed to treat internal wounds and engineered nucleoporin-like polypeptide
      (NLP) hydrogels that act as biologically selective filters. We believe that the
      fundamental physical chemistry questions articulated in this Account will provide
      inspiration to fully understand the design of polymer networks, a group of
      mysterious yet critically important materials.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Extracting data from publication reports is a standard process in
      systematic review (SR) development. However, the data extraction process still
      relies too much on manual effort which is slow, costly, and subject to human
      error. In this study, we developed a text summarization system aimed at enhancing
      productivity and reducing errors in the traditional data extraction process.
      METHODS: We developed a computer system that used machine learning and natural
      language processing approaches to automatically generate summaries of full-text
      scientific publications. The summaries at the sentence and fragment levels were
      evaluated in finding common clinical SR data elements such as sample size, group 
      size, and PICO values. We compared the computer-generated summaries with human
      written summaries (title and abstract) in terms of the presence of necessary
      information for the data extraction as presented in the Cochrane review's study
      characteristics tables. RESULTS: At the sentence level, the computer-generated
      summaries covered more information than humans do for systematic reviews (recall 
      91.2% vs. 83.8%, p<0.001). They also had a better density of relevant sentences
      (precision 59% vs. 39%, p<0.001). At the fragment level, the ensemble approach
      combining rule-based, concept mapping, and dictionary-based methods performed
      better than individual methods alone, achieving an 84.7% F-measure. CONCLUSION:
      Computer-generated summaries are potential alternative information sources for
      data extraction in systematic review development. Machine learning and natural
      language processing are promising approaches to the development of such an
      extractive summarization system.

TI  - Detecting Target Objects by Natural Language Instructions Using an RGB-D Camera.
LID - E2117 [pii]
AB  - Controlling robots by natural language (NL) is increasingly attracting attention 
      for its versatility, convenience and no need of extensive training for users.
      Grounding is a crucial challenge of this problem to enable robots to understand
      NL instructions from humans. This paper mainly explores the object grounding
      problem and concretely studies how to detect target objects by the NL
      instructions using an RGB-D camera in robotic manipulation applications. In
      particular, a simple yet robust vision algorithm is applied to segment objects of
      interest. With the metric information of all segmented objects, the object
      attributes and relations between objects are further extracted. The NL
      instructions that incorporate multiple cues for object specifications are parsed 
      into domain-specific annotations. The annotations from NL and extracted
      information from the RGB-D camera are matched in a computational state estimation
      framework to search all possible object grounding states. The final grounding is 
      accomplished by selecting the states which have the maximum probabilities. An
      RGB-D scene dataset associated with different groups of NL instructions based on 
      different cognition levels of the robot are collected. Quantitative evaluations
      on the dataset illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. The experiments 
      of NL controlled object manipulation and NL-based task programming using a mobile
      manipulator show its effectiveness and practicability in robotic applications.

PG  - 904-907
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare differences in demographics and outcomes in childhood
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) presenting at the Children's Hospital Lahore (CHL), and
      Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH), UK. STUDY DESIGN: An observational comparative
      study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: From January 2011 to February 2012 at CH,
      Lahore and from October 2008 to February 2012 at RMH, UK. METHODOLOGY:
      Consecutive HL patients (50 from each hospital) were inducted. Data regarding
      age, gender, staging, histopathology and outcome were analysed. Clinical and
      pathological staging done according to Ann-Arbor and World Health Organization
      classification. Treatment duration was 6-8 months. They were followed for 6
      months post-treatment. Frequencies of variables were noted and compared.
      Chi-square test was used for determining significance. RESULTS: Patients from
      Children's Hospital, Lahore were younger (mean 7.9 years) with male predominance 
      (n=42, 84%). Histopathology showed Mixed Cellularity (MC) in 32 (64%), Nodular
      Sclerosis (NS) in 5 (10%), Lymphocyte Rich in 4 (8%) and lymphocyte depleted in 1
      (2%), nodular lymphocyte predominant (NLP) in 1 (2%) each. Majority presented in 
      stage IV (n=25,50%), or stage III (n=20,40%). Constitutional B symptoms were
      present in 37 (74%). Bone marrow involvement observed in 23 (46%). Remission was 
      achieved in 42 (84%) patients; 2 (4%) relapsed, 4 (8%) expired and 2 (4%) left
      against medical advice. In contrast, RMH patients were older (mean 11.8 years.)
      and 30 (60%) were males. NS (n=40,80%) and NLP (n=6,12%) types were predominant. 
      Two (4%) patients were in stage I, 27 (54%) in stage II, 12 (24%) in stage III
      and 9 (18%) presented in stage IV. Fourteen (28%) had B-symptoms. None had bone
      marrow disease. Event free survival was 46 (92%). Four (8%) patients relapsed.
      Three responded to second line therapy and one relapsed postautologous
      transplant. CONCLUSION: Significant differences were observed in age at
      presentation, stage, histopathology and extent of bone marrow involvement between
      the groups. Of interest is the bone marrow involvement in stage IV patients in
      Pakistan. Delayed diagnosis account for advanced stage but difference in
      pathological subtype needs further study.

TI  - A corpus for mining drug-related knowledge from Twitter chatter: Language models 
      and their utilities.
PG  - 122-131
AB  - In this data article, we present to the data science, natural language processing
      and public heath communities an unlabeled corpus and a set of language models. We
      collected the data from Twitter using drug names as keywords, including their
      common misspelled forms. Using this data, which is rich in drug-related chatter, 
      we developed language models to aid the development of data mining tools and
      methods in this domain. We generated several models that capture (i) distributed 
      word representations and (ii) probabilities of n-gram sequences. The data set we 
      are releasing consists of 267,215 Twitter posts made during the four-month
      period-November, 2014 to February, 2015. The posts mention over 250 drug-related 
      keywords. The language models encapsulate semantic and sequential properties of
      the texts.

TI  - Comparison of Three Information Sources for Smoking Information in Electronic
      Health Records.
PG  - 237-242
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim was to compare independent and joint performance of
      retrieving smoking status through different sources, including narrative text
      processed by natural language processing (NLP), patient-provided information
      (PPI), and diagnosis codes (ie, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
      Revision [ICD-9]). We also compared the performance of retrieving smoking
      strength information (ie, heavy/light smoker) from narrative text and PPI.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study leveraged an existing lung cancer cohort for
      smoking status, amount, and strength information, which was manually
      chart-reviewed. On the NLP side, smoking-related electronic medical record (EMR) 
      data were retrieved first. A pattern-based smoking information extraction module 
      was then implemented to extract smoking-related information. After that,
      heuristic rules were used to obtain smoking status-related information. Smoking
      information was also obtained from structured data sources based on diagnosis
      codes and PPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were measured using
      patients with coverage (ie, the proportion of patients whose smoking
      status/strength can be effectively determined). RESULTS: NLP alone has the best
      overall performance for smoking status extraction (patient coverage: 0.88;
      sensitivity: 0.97; specificity: 0.70; accuracy: 0.88); combining PPI with NLP
      further improved patient coverage to 0.96. ICD-9 does not provide additional
      improvement to NLP and its combination with PPI. For smoking strength, combining 
      NLP with PPI has slight improvement over NLP alone. CONCLUSION: These findings
      suggest that narrative text could serve as a more reliable and comprehensive
      source for obtaining smoking-related information than structured data sources.
      PPI, the readily available structured data, could be used as a complementary
      source for more comprehensive patient coverage.

TI  - The Outcome of Endoscopic Transethmosphenoid Optic Canal Decompression for
      Indirect Traumatic Optic Neuropathy with No-Light-Perception.
PG  - 6492858
AB  - Purpose. To present the safety and effect of endoscopic transethmosphenoid optic 
      canal decompression (ETOCD) for indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (ITON)
      patients with no-light-perception (NLP). Methods. A retrospective study performed
      on 96 patients (96 eyes) with NLP after ITON between June 1, 2010, and June 1,
      2015, who underwent ETOCD, was reviewed. Visual outcome before and after
      treatment was taken into comparison. Results. The overall visual acuity
      improvement rate after surgery was 46.9%. The improvement rates of visual acuity 
      of patients who received treatment within 3 days of injury, 3-7 days after
      injury, and later than 7 days were 63.6%, 42.9%, and 35.7%, respectively.
      Statistically significant difference was detected between the effective rates of 
      within-3-day group and later-than-7-day group (chi2 = 5.772, P = 0.016). The
      effective rate of atrophy group and nonatrophy group was 25.0% and 51.3%,
      respectively. The effective rate was significantly higher in nonatrophy group
      (chi2 = 4.417, P = 0.036). Conclusion. For patients suffering from ITON with NLP,
      time to medical treatment within 3 days is an influential factor for visual
      prognosis. Optic nerve atrophy is an important predictor for visual prognosis.
      Treatment should still be recommended even for cases of delayed presentation to
      hospital.

TI  - Simplifying EHR Overview of Critically Ill Patients Through Vital Signs
      Monitoring.
AB  - This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to graphical presentation of
      text-based electronic health records (EHR) while maintaining all textual
      information. We have developed the Patient Condition Timeline (PCT) tool, which
      creates a timeline representation of a patients' physiological condition during
      admission. PCT is based on electronical monitoring of vital signs and then
      combining these into Early Warning Scores (EWS). Hereafter, techniques from
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) are applied on existing EHR to extract all
      entries. Finally, the two methods are combined into an interactive timeline
      featuring the ability to see drastic changes in the patients' health, and thereby
      enabling staff to see where in the EHR critical events have taken place.

TI  - Microbial phenomics information extractor (MicroPIE): a natural language
      processing tool for the automated acquisition of prokaryotic phenotypic
      characters from text sources.
PG  - 528
AB  - BACKGROUND: The large-scale analysis of phenomic data (i.e., full phenotypic
      traits of an organism, such as shape, metabolic substrates, and growth
      conditions) in microbial bioinformatics has been hampered by the lack of tools to
      rapidly and accurately extract phenotypic data from existing legacy text in the
      field of microbiology. To quickly obtain knowledge on the distribution and
      evolution of microbial traits, an information extraction system needed to be
      developed to extract phenotypic characters from large numbers of taxonomic
      descriptions so they can be used as input to existing phylogenetic analysis
      software packages. RESULTS: We report the development and evaluation of Microbial
      Phenomics Information Extractor (MicroPIE, version 0.1.0). MicroPIE is a natural 
      language processing application that uses a robust supervised classification
      algorithm (Support Vector Machine) to identify characters from sentences in
      prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions, followed by a combination of algorithms
      applying linguistic rules with groups of known terms to extract characters as
      well as character states. The input to MicroPIE is a set of taxonomic
      descriptions (clean text). The output is a taxon-by-character matrix-with taxa in
      the rows and a set of 42 pre-defined characters (e.g., optimum growth
      temperature) in the columns. The performance of MicroPIE was evaluated against a 
      gold standard matrix and another student-made matrix. Results show that, compared
      to the gold standard, MicroPIE extracted 21 characters (50%) with a Relaxed F1
      score > 0.80 and 16 characters (38%) with Relaxed F1 scores ranging between 0.50 
      and 0.80. Inclusion of a character prediction component (SVM) improved the
      overall performance of MicroPIE, notably the precision. Evaluated against the
      same gold standard, MicroPIE performed significantly better than the
      undergraduate students. CONCLUSION: MicroPIE is a promising new tool for the
      rapid and efficient extraction of phenotypic character information from
      prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions. However, further development, including
      incorporation of ontologies, will be necessary to improve the performance of the 
      extraction for some character types.

TI  - Large-scale identification of patients with cerebral aneurysms using natural
      language processing.
PG  - 164-168
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000003490 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use natural language processing (NLP) in conjunction with the
      electronic medical record (EMR) to accurately identify patients with cerebral
      aneurysms and their matched controls. METHODS: ICD-9 and Current Procedural
      Terminology codes were used to obtain an initial data mart of potential aneurysm 
      patients from the EMR. NLP was then used to train a classification algorithm with
      .632 bootstrap cross-validation used for correction of overfitting bias. The
      classification rule was then applied to the full data mart. Additional validation
      was performed on 300 patients classified as having aneurysms. Controls were
      obtained by matching age, sex, race, and healthcare use. RESULTS: We identified
      55,675 patients of 4.2 million patients with ICD-9 and Current Procedural
      Terminology codes consistent with cerebral aneurysms. Of those, 16,823 patients
      had the term aneurysm occur near relevant anatomic terms. After training, a final
      algorithm consisting of 8 coded and 14 NLP variables was selected, yielding an
      overall area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.95. After the
      final algorithm was applied, 5,589 patients were classified as having aneurysms, 
      and 54,952 controls were matched to those patients. The positive predictive value
      based on a validation cohort of 300 patients was 0.86. CONCLUSIONS: We harnessed 
      the power of the EMR by applying NLP to obtain a large cohort of patients with
      intracranial aneurysms and their matched controls. Such algorithms can be
      generalized to other diseases for epidemiologic and genetic studies.

TI  - A Concept-Wide Association Study of Clinical Notes to Discover New Predictors of 
      Kidney Failure.
PG  - 2150-2158
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Identifying predictors of kidney disease progression
      is critical toward the development of strategies to prevent kidney failure.
      Clinical notes provide a unique opportunity for big data approaches to identify
      novel risk factors for disease. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We
      used natural language processing tools to extract concepts from the preceding
      year's clinical notes among patients newly referred to a tertiary care center's
      outpatient nephrology clinics and retrospectively evaluated these concepts as
      predictors for the subsequent development of ESRD using proportional
      subdistribution hazards (competing risk) regression. The primary outcome was time
      to ESRD, accounting for a competing risk of death. We identified predictors from 
      univariate and multivariate (adjusting for Tangri linear predictor) models using 
      a 5% threshold for false discovery rate (q value <0.05). We included all patients
      seen by an adult outpatient nephrologist between January 1, 2004 and June 18,
      2014 and excluded patients seen only by transplant nephrology, with preexisting
      ESRD, with fewer than five clinical notes, with no follow-up, or with no baseline
      creatinine values. RESULTS: Among the 4013 patients selected in the final study
      cohort, we identified 960 concepts in the unadjusted analysis and 885 concepts in
      the adjusted analysis. Novel predictors identified included high-dose ascorbic
      acid (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.48; 95% confidence interval, 2.80 to 10.70;
      q<0.001) and fast food (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.34; 95% confidence interval,
      2.55 to 7.40; q<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Novel predictors of human disease may be
      identified using an unbiased approach to analyze text from the electronic health 
      record.

AB  - Bioinformatics and computational biology play a critical role in bioscience and
      biomedical research. As researchers design their experimental projects, one major
      challenge is to find the most relevant bioinformatics toolkits that will lead to 
      new knowledge discovery from their data. The Bio-TDS (Bioscience Query Tool
      Discovery Systems, http://biotds.org/) has been developed to assist researchers
      in retrieving the most applicable analytic tools by allowing them to formulate
      their questions as free text. The Bio-TDS is a flexible retrieval system that
      affords users from multiple bioscience domains (e.g. genomic, proteomic,
      bio-imaging) the ability to query over 12 000 analytic tool descriptions
      integrated from well-established, community repositories. One of the primary
      components of the Bio-TDS is the ontology and natural language processing
      workflow for annotation, curation, query processing, and evaluation. The
      Bio-TDS's scientific impact was evaluated using sample questions posed by
      researchers retrieved from Biostars, a site focusing on BIOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS:
      The Bio-TDS was compared to five similar bioscience analytic tool retrieval
      systems with the Bio-TDS outperforming the others in terms of relevance and
      completeness. The Bio-TDS offers researchers the capacity to associate their
      bioscience question with the most relevant computational toolsets required for
      the data analysis in their knowledge discovery process.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the impacts that structuring of electronic health records
      (EHRs) has had from the perspective of secondary use of patient data as reflected
      in currently published literature. This paper presents the results of a
      systematic literature review aimed at answering the following questions; (1) what
      are the common methods of structuring patient data to serve secondary use
      purposes; (2) what are the common methods of evaluating patient data structuring 
      in the secondary use context, and (3) what impacts or outcomes of EHR structuring
      have been reported from the secondary use perspective. METHODS: The reported
      study forms part of a wider systematic literature review on the impacts of EHR
      structuring methods and evaluations of their impact. The review was based on a
      12-step systematic review protocol adapted from the Cochrane methodology.
      Original articles included in the study were divided into three groups for
      analysis and reporting based on their use focus: nursing documentation, medical
      use and secondary use (presented in this paper). The analysis from the
      perspective of secondary use of data includes 85 original articles from 1975 to
      2010 retrieved from 15 bibliographic databases. RESULTS: The implementation of
      structured EHRs can be roughly divided into applications for documenting patient 
      data at the point of care and application for retrieval of patient data (post hoc
      structuring). Two thirds of the secondary use articles concern EHR structuring
      methods which were still under development or in the testing phase. METHODS: of
      structuring patient data such as codes, terminologies, reference information
      models, forms or templates and documentation standards were usually applied in
      combination. Most of the identified benefits of utilizing structured EHR data for
      secondary use purposes concentrated on information content and quality or on
      technical quality and reliability, particularly in the case of Natural Language
      Processing (NLP) studies. A few individual articles evaluated impacts on care
      processes, productivity and costs, patient safety, care quality or other health
      impacts. In most articles these endpoints were usually discussed as goals of
      secondary use and less as evidence-supported impacts, resulting from the use of
      structured EHR data for secondary purposes. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies and more
      sound evaluation methods are needed for evidence on how EHRs are utilized for
      secondary purposes, and how structured documentation methods can serve different 
      users' needs, e.g. administration, statistics and research and development, in
      parallel to medical use purposes.

TI  - Comparing vector-based and Bayesian memory models using large-scale datasets:
      User-generated hashtag and tag prediction on Twitter and Stack Overflow.
PG  - 542-565
AB  - The growth of social media and user-created content on online sites provides
      unique opportunities to study models of human declarative memory. By framing the 
      task of choosing a hashtag for a tweet and tagging a post on Stack Overflow as a 
      declarative memory retrieval problem, 2 cognitively plausible declarative memory 
      models were applied to millions of posts and tweets and evaluated on how
      accurately they predict a user's chosen tags. An ACT-R based Bayesian model and a
      random permutation vector-based model were tested on the large data sets. The
      results show that past user behavior of tag use is a strong predictor of future
      behavior. Furthermore, past behavior was successfully incorporated into the
      random permutation model that previously used only context. Also, ACT-R's
      attentional weight term was linked to an entropy-weighting natural language
      processing method used to attenuate high-frequency words (e.g., articles and
      prepositions). Word order was not found to be a strong predictor of tag use, and 
      the random permutation model performed comparably to the Bayesian model without
      including word order. This shows that the strength of the random permutation
      model is not in the ability to represent word order, but rather in the way in
      which context information is successfully compressed. The results of the
      large-scale exploration show how the architecture of the 2 memory models can be
      modified to significantly improve accuracy, and may suggest task-independent
      general modifications that can help improve model fit to human data in a much
      wider range of domains. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Finding Important Terms for Patients in Their Electronic Health Records: A
      Learning-to-Rank Approach Using Expert Annotations.
PG  - e40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many health organizations allow patients to access their own
      electronic health record (EHR) notes through online patient portals as a way to
      enhance patient-centered care. However, EHR notes are typically long and contain 
      abundant medical jargon that can be difficult for patients to understand. In
      addition, many medical terms in patients' notes are not directly related to their
      health care needs. One way to help patients better comprehend their own notes is 
      to reduce information overload and help them focus on medical terms that matter
      most to them. Interventions can then be developed by giving them targeted
      education to improve their EHR comprehension and the quality of care. OBJECTIVE: 
      We aimed to develop a supervised natural language processing (NLP) system called 
      Finding impOrtant medical Concepts most Useful to patientS (FOCUS) that
      automatically identifies and ranks medical terms in EHR notes based on their
      importance to the patients. METHODS: First, we built an expert-annotated corpus. 
      For each EHR note, 2 physicians independently identified medical terms important 
      to the patient. Using the physicians' agreement as the gold standard, we
      developed and evaluated FOCUS. FOCUS first identifies candidate terms from each
      EHR note using MetaMap and then ranks the terms using a support vector
      machine-based learn-to-rank algorithm. We explored rich learning features,
      including distributed word representation, Unified Medical Language System
      semantic type, topic features, and features derived from consumer health
      vocabulary. We compared FOCUS with 2 strong baseline NLP systems. RESULTS:
      Physicians annotated 90 EHR notes and identified a mean of 9 (SD 5) important
      terms per note. The Cohen's kappa annotation agreement was .51. The 10-fold
      cross-validation results show that FOCUS achieved an area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.940 for ranking candidate terms
      from EHR notes to identify important terms. When including term identification,
      the performance of FOCUS for identifying important terms from EHR notes was 0.866
      AUC-ROC. Both performance scores significantly exceeded the corresponding
      baseline system scores (P<.001). Rich learning features contributed to FOCUS's
      performance substantially. CONCLUSIONS: FOCUS can automatically rank terms from
      EHR notes based on their importance to patients. It may help develop future
      interventions that improve quality of care.

TI  - Closantel; a veterinary drug with potential severe morbidity in humans.
PG  - 207
AB  - BACKGROUND: Closantel is a halogenated salicylanilide with a potent anti
      parasitic activity. It is widely used in management of parasitic infestation in
      animals, but is contraindicated in humans. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old man
      with depression was referred to our center with progressive loss of vision in
      both eyes 10 days after unintentional ingestion of three 500 mg tablets of
      Closantel. On fundus examination, left optic disc margin was blurred. His
      bilateral visual acuity was no light perception (NLP) despite prescribed IV
      erythropoietin injections 20,000 units daily for 3 days and 1gr intravenous
      methylprednisolone acetate for 3 days followed by 1 mg/kg oral prednisolone. On
      macular optical coherence tomography (OCT), a disruption in outer retina was
      observed. Electroretinogram and visual evoked potential tests showed visual
      pathway involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Destruction of neurosensory retina and visual
      pathways after accidental Closantel use is related to severe visual loss. This
      case alerts us about the destructive effect of this drug on humans even in low
      dosage which necessitates preventive efforts to reduce the chance of this morbid 
      side effect.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Incorrect imaging protocol selection can contribute to 
      increased healthcare cost and waste. To help healthcare providers improve the
      quality and safety of medical imaging services, we developed and evaluated three 
      natural language processing (NLP) models to determine whether NLP techniques
      could be employed to aid in clinical decision support for protocoling and
      prioritization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain examinations. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: To test the feasibility of using an NLP model to support clinical
      decision making for MRI brain examinations, we designed three different medical
      imaging prediction tasks, each with a unique outcome: selecting an examination
      protocol, evaluating the need for contrast administration, and determining
      priority. We created three models for each prediction task, each using a
      different classification algorithm-random forest, support vector machine, or
      k-nearest neighbor-to predict outcomes based on the narrative clinical
      indications and demographic data associated with 13,982 MRI brain examinations
      performed from January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2015. Test datasets were used to
      calculate the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, predictive values, and the
      area under the curve. RESULTS: Our optimal results show an accuracy of 82.9%,
      83.0%, and 88.2% for the protocol selection, contrast administration, and
      prioritization tasks, respectively, demonstrating that predictive algorithms can 
      be used to aid in clinical decision support for examination protocoling.
      CONCLUSIONS: NLP models developed from the narrative clinical information
      provided by referring clinicians and demographic data are feasible methods to
      predict the protocol and priority of MRI brain examinations.

TI  - Determining Multiple Sclerosis Phenotype from Electronic Medical Records.
PG  - 1377-1382
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a central nervous system disease in which
      nerve signals are disrupted by scarring and demyelination, is classified into
      phenotypes depending on the patterns of cognitive or physical impairment
      progression: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary-progressive MS (PPMS),
      secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), or progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). The
      phenotype is important in managing the disease and determining appropriate
      treatment. The ICD-9-CM code 340.0 is uninformative about MS phenotype, which
      increases the difficulty of studying the effects of phenotype on disease.
      OBJECTIVE: To identify MS phenotype using natural language processing (NLP)
      techniques on progress notes and other clinical text in the electronic medical
      record (EMR). METHODS: Patients with at least 2 ICD-9-CM codes for MS (340.0)
      from 1999 through 2010 were identified from nationwide EMR data in the Department
      of Veterans Affairs. Clinical experts were interviewed for possible keywords and 
      phrases denoting MS phenotype in order to develop a data dictionary for NLP. For 
      each patient, NLP was used to search EMR clinical notes, since the first MS
      diagnosis date for these keywords and phrases. Presence of phenotype-related
      keywords and phrases were analyzed in context to remove mentions that were
      negated (e.g., "not relapsing-remitting") or unrelated to MS (e.g., "RR" meaning 
      "respiratory rate"). One thousand mentions of MS phenotype were validated, and
      all records of 150 patients were reviewed for missed mentions. RESULTS: There
      were 7,756 MS patients identified by ICD-9-CM code 340.0. MS phenotype was
      identified for 2,854 (36.8%) patients, with 1,836 (64.3%) of those having just 1 
      phenotype mentioned in their EMR clinical notes: 1,118 (39.2%) RRMS, 325 (11.4%) 
      PPMS, 374 (13.1%) SPMS, and 19 (0.7%) PRMS. A total of 747 patients (26.2%) had 2
      phenotypes, the most common being 459 patients (16.1%) with RRMS and SPMS. A
      total of 213 patients (7.5%) had 3 phenotypes, and 58 patients (2.0%) had 4
      phenotypes mentioned in their EMR clinical notes. Positive predictive value of
      phenotype identification was 93.8% with sensitivity of 94.0%. CONCLUSIONS:
      Phenotype was documented for slightly more than one third of MS patients, an
      important but disappointing finding that sets a limit on studying the effects of 
      phenotype on MS in general. However, for cases where the phenotype was
      documented, NLP accurately identified the phenotypes. Having multiple phenotypes 
      documented is consistent with disease progression. The most common
      misidentification was because of ambiguity while clinicians were trying to
      determine phenotype. This study brings attention to the need for care providers
      to document MS phenotype more consistently and provides a solution for capturing 
      phenotype from clinical text. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by Anolinx and
      F. Hoffman-La Roche. Nelson serves as a consultant for Anolinx. Kamauu is owner

PG  - e013591
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013591 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine links between clinical and other characteristics of people
      with Alzheimer's disease living in the community, likelihood of care home or
      hospital admission, and associated costs. DESIGN: Observational data extracted
      from clinical records using natural language processing and Hospital Episode
      Statistics. Statistical analyses examined effects of cognition, physical health, 
      mental health, sociodemographic factors and living circumstances on risk of
      admission to care home or hospital over 6 months and associated costs, adjusting 
      for repeated observations. SETTING: Catchment area for South London and Maudsley 
      National Health Service Foundation Trust, provider for 1.2 million people in
      Southeast London. PARTICIPANTS: Every individual with diagnosis of Alzheimer's
      disease seen and treated by mental health services in the catchment area, with at
      least one rating of cognition, not resident in care home at time of assessment
      (n=3075). INTERVENTIONS: Usual treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of
      admission to, and days spent in three settings during 6-month period following
      routine clinical assessment: care home, mental health inpatient care and general 
      hospital inpatient care. RESULTS: Predictors of probability of care home or
      hospital admission and/or associated costs over 6 months include cognition,
      functional problems, agitation, depression, physical illness, previous
      hospitalisations, age, gender, ethnicity, living alone and having a partner.
      Patterns of association differed considerably by destination. CONCLUSIONS: Most
      people with dementia prefer to remain in their own homes, and funding bodies see 
      this as cheaper than institutionalisation. Better treatment in the community that
      reduces health and social care needs of Alzheimer's patients would reduce
      admission rates. Living alone, poor living circumstances and functional problems 
      all raise admission rates, and so major cuts in social care budgets increase the 
      risk of high-cost admissions which older people do not want. Routinely collected 
      data can be used to reveal local patterns of admission and costs.

AB  - Comprehensive data mining of the scientific literature has become an increasing
      challenge. To address this challenge, Elsevier's Pathway Studio software uses the
      techniques of natural language processing to systematically extract specific
      biological information from journal articles and abstracts that is then used to
      create a very large, structured, and constantly expanding literature
      knowledgebase. Highly sophisticated visualization tools allow the user to
      interactively explore the vast number of connections created and stored in the
      Pathway Studio database. We demonstrate the value of this structured information 
      approach by way of a biomarker use case example and describe a comprehensive
      collection of biomarkers and biomarker candidates, as reported in the literature.
      We use four major neuropsychiatric diseases to demonstrate common and unique
      biomarker elements, demonstrate specific enrichment patterns, and highlight
      strategies for identifying the most recent and novel reports for potential
      biomarker discovery. Finally, we introduce an innovative new taxonomy based on
      brain region identifications, which greatly increases the potential depth and
      complexity of information retrieval related to, and now accessible for,
      neuroscience research.

AB  - We report on a tunable noise-like pulse (NLP) generation in a mode-locked Tm
      fiber laser with a SESAM. A tuning range of 1895-1942 nm, while keeping the
      spectral bandwidth of 10-19 nm under NLP mode-locked operation, was obtained by a
      tunable filter based on chromatic dispersion of telescope lenses. At the center
      wavelength of 1928 nm, the maximum output power of 195 mW with the spectral
      bandwidth of 18.9 nm was obtained. The repetition rate was 20.5 MHz and the
      corresponding pulse energy was 9.5 nJ. To our knowledge, this is the first report
      of a tunable NLP mode-locked laser based on chromatic dispersion of a lens
      system.

TI  - Introducing Explorer of Taxon Concepts with a case study on spider measurement
      matrix building.
PG  - 471
AB  - BACKGROUND: Taxonomic descriptions are traditionally composed in natural language
      and published in a format that cannot be directly used by computers. The
      Exploring Taxon Concepts (ETC) project has been developing a set of web-based
      software tools that convert morphological descriptions published in telegraphic
      style to character data that can be reused and repurposed. This paper introduces 
      the first semi-automated pipeline, to our knowledge, that converts morphological 
      descriptions into taxon-character matrices to support systematics and
      evolutionary biology research. We then demonstrate and evaluate the use of the
      ETC Input Creation - Text Capture - Matrix Generation pipeline to generate body
      part measurement matrices from a set of 188 spider morphological descriptions and
      report the findings. RESULTS: From the given set of spider taxonomic
      publications, two versions of input (original and normalized) were generated and 
      used by the ETC Text Capture and ETC Matrix Generation tools. The tools produced 
      two corresponding spider body part measurement matrices, and the matrix from the 
      normalized input was found to be much more similar to a gold standard matrix
      hand-curated by the scientist co-authors. Special conventions utilized in the
      original descriptions (e.g., the omission of measurement units) were attributed
      to the lower performance of using the original input. The results show that
      simple normalization of the description text greatly increased the quality of the
      machine-generated matrix and reduced edit effort. The machine-generated matrix
      also helped identify issues in the gold standard matrix. CONCLUSIONS: ETC Text
      Capture and ETC Matrix Generation are low-barrier and effective tools for
      extracting measurement values from spider taxonomic descriptions and are more
      effective when the descriptions are self-contained. Special conventions that make
      the description text less self-contained challenge automated extraction of data
      from biodiversity descriptions and hinder the automated reuse of the published
      knowledge. The tools will be updated to support new requirements revealed in this
      case study.

      and Reporting.
PG  - 32-40
LID - 10.3928/00989134-20161109-01 [doi]
AB  - Delirium, a life-threatening complication for hospitalized older adults
      associated with adverse outcomes, is often underrecognized and underreported. The
      purpose of the current study was to analyze delirium documentation for
      hospitalized older adults. Charts of 34 patients, aged 71 and older with
      documented delirium and referral to a Hospital Elder Life Program, were reviewed.
      With the exception of International Classification of Diseases-9 coding, delirium
      was only mentioned in 12 (35.3%) charts, although descriptors potentially
      indicative of delirium were usually recorded. Of these, the most frequently
      recorded were confusion (94.1%), mental status change (70.6%), and disorientation
      (61.8%). When nurses charted delirium descriptors, only 5.9% of their notes
      included physician referral. Physician responses were to order diagnostic tests
      and medications, usually antipsychotic or benzodiazepine agents. Of 28 patients
      requiring transfer to another facility after discharge, delirium was mentioned in
      only one transfer note. Commonly used delirium descriptors can be used for the
      development of natural language processing tools for clinical decision support.

TI  - Investigation of noise-like pulses from a net normal Yb-doped fiber laser based
      on a nonlinear polarization rotation mechanism.
PG  - 5310-5313
LID - 10.1364/OL.41.005310 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the characteristics of noise-like pulses (NLPs) from a net normal
      dispersion Yb-doped fiber laser (YDFL) by using the grating pairs (GPs) inside
      the laser cavity as a dispersion compensation element. Without the insertion of
      the slit inside the laser cavity, the operation of the YDFL is at an NLP state
      with the double-scale intensity autocorrelation trace once the mode-locked pulses
      are generated. Through the dispersion delay line outside the laser cavity, the
      substantial temporal compression of the NLPs has been demonstrated. After
      inserting the slit between the GPs as a bandpass filter, the operation state of
      the YDFL can be switched between the NLPs and the dissipated solitons by means of
      a pump power. Besides, the NLPs can also transit to the bound solitons as the
      YDFL is operated within long and short wavelength regimes through the spatial
      shift of the slit.

TI  - Web-based Real-Time Case Finding for the Population Health Management of Patients
      With Diabetes Mellitus: A Prospective Validation of the Natural Language
      Processing-Based Algorithm With Statewide Electronic Medical Records.
PG  - e37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes case finding based on structured medical records does not
      fully identify diabetic patients whose medical histories related to diabetes are 
      available in the form of free text. Manual chart reviews have been used but
      involve high labor costs and long latency. OBJECTIVE: This study developed and
      tested a Web-based diabetes case finding algorithm using both structured and
      unstructured electronic medical records (EMRs). METHODS: This study was based on 
      the health information exchange (HIE) EMR database that covers almost all health 
      facilities in the state of Maine, United States. Using narrative clinical notes, 
      a Web-based natural language processing (NLP) case finding algorithm was
      retrospectively (July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2013) developed with a random subset
      of HIE-associated facilities, which was then blind tested with the remaining
      facilities. The NLP-based algorithm was subsequently integrated into the HIE
      database and validated prospectively (July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2014). RESULTS:
      Of the 935,891 patients in the prospective cohort, 64,168 diabetes cases were
      identified using diagnosis codes alone. Our NLP-based case finding algorithm
      prospectively found an additional 5756 uncodified cases (5756/64,168, 8.97%
      increase) with a positive predictive value of .90. Of the 21,720 diabetic
      patients identified by both methods, 6616 patients (6616/21,720, 30.46%) were
      identified by the NLP-based algorithm before a diabetes diagnosis was noted in
      the structured EMR (mean time difference = 48 days). CONCLUSIONS: The online NLP 
      algorithm was effective in identifying uncodified diabetes cases in real time,
      leading to a significant improvement in diabetes case finding. The successful
      integration of the NLP-based case finding algorithm into the Maine HIE database
      indicates a strong potential for application of this novel method to achieve a
      more complete ascertainment of diagnoses of diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Clinical Natural Language Processing in 2015: Leveraging the Variety of Texts of 
      Clinical Interest.
PG  - 234-239
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize recent research and present a selection of the best
      papers published in 2015 in the field of clinical Natural Language Processing
      (NLP). METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was performed by the two
      section editors of the IMIA Yearbook NLP section by searching bibliographic
      databases with a focus on NLP efforts applied to clinical texts or aimed at a
      clinical outcome. Section editors first selected a shortlist of candidate best
      papers that were then peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. RESULTS:
      The clinical NLP best paper selection shows that clinical NLP is making use of a 
      variety of texts of clinical interest to contribute to the analysis of clinical
      information and the building of a body of clinical knowledge. The full review
      process highlighted five papers analyzing patient-authored texts or seeking to
      connect and aggregate multiple sources of information. They provide a
      contribution to the development of methods, resources, applications, and
      sometimes a combination of these aspects. CONCLUSIONS: The field of clinical NLP 
      continues to thrive through the contributions of both NLP researchers and
      healthcare professionals interested in applying NLP techniques to impact clinical
      practice. Foundational progress in the field makes it possible to leverage a
      larger variety of texts of clinical interest for healthcare purposes.

TI  - Aspiring to Unintended Consequences of Natural Language Processing: A Review of
      Recent Developments in Clinical and Consumer-Generated Text Processing.
PG  - 224-233
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper reviews work over the past two years in Natural Language
      Processing (NLP) applied to clinical and consumer-generated texts. METHODS: We
      included any application or methodological publication that leverages text to
      facilitate healthcare and address the health-related needs of consumers and
      populations. RESULTS: Many important developments in clinical text processing,
      both foundational and task-oriented, were addressed in community- wide
      evaluations and discussed in corresponding special issues that are referenced in 
      this review. These focused issues and in-depth reviews of several other active
      research areas, such as pharmacovigilance and summarization, allowed us to
      discuss in greater depth disease modeling and predictive analytics using clinical
      texts, and text analysis in social media for healthcare quality assessment,
      trends towards online interventions based on rapid analysis of health-related
      posts, and consumer health question answering, among other issues. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our analysis shows that although clinical NLP continues to advance towards
      practical applications and more NLP methods are used in large-scale live health
      information applications, more needs to be done to make NLP use in clinical
      applications a routine widespread reality. Progress in clinical NLP is mirrored
      by developments in social media text analysis: the research is moving from
      capturing trends to addressing individual health-related posts, thus showing
      potential to become a tool for precision medicine and a valuable addition to the 
      standard healthcare quality evaluation tools.

TI  - Using machine learning to parse breast pathology reports.
PG  - 203-211
LID - 10.1007/s10549-016-4035-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Extracting information from electronic medical record is a
      time-consuming and expensive process when done manually. Rule-based and machine
      learning techniques are two approaches to solving this problem. In this study, we
      trained a machine learning model on pathology reports to extract pertinent tumor 
      characteristics, which enabled us to create a large database of attribute
      searchable pathology reports. This database can be used to identify cohorts of
      patients with characteristics of interest. METHODS: We collected a total of
      91,505 breast pathology reports from three Partners hospitals: Massachusetts
      General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital,
      covering the period from 1978 to 2016. We trained our system with annotations
      from two datasets, consisting of 6295 and 10,841 manually annotated reports. The 
      system extracts 20 separate categories of information, including atypia types and
      various tumor characteristics such as receptors. We also report a learning curve 
      analysis to show how much annotation our model needs to perform reasonably.
      RESULTS: The model accuracy was tested on 500 reports that did not overlap with
      the training set. The model achieved accuracy of 90% for correctly parsing all
      carcinoma and atypia categories for a given patient. The average accuracy for
      individual categories was 97%. Using this classifier, we created a database of
      91,505 parsed pathology reports. CONCLUSIONS: Our learning curve analysis shows
      that the model can achieve reasonable results even when trained on a few
      annotations. We developed a user-friendly interface to the database that allows
      physicians to easily identify patients with target characteristics and export the
      matching cohort. This model has the potential to reduce the effort required for
      analyzing large amounts of data from medical records, and to minimize the cost
      and time required to glean scientific insight from these data.

TI  - Identification of Long Bone Fractures in Radiology Reports Using Natural Language
      Processing to support Healthcare Quality Improvement.
PG  - 1051-1068
AB  - BACKGROUND: Important information to support healthcare quality improvement is
      often recorded in free text documents such as radiology reports. Natural language
      processing (NLP) methods may help extract this information, but these methods
      have rarely been applied outside the research laboratories where they were
      developed. OBJECTIVE: To implement and validate NLP tools to identify long bone
      fractures for pediatric emergency medicine quality improvement. METHODS: Using
      freely available statistical software packages, we implemented NLP methods to
      identify long bone fractures from radiology reports. A sample of 1,000 radiology 
      reports was used to construct three candidate classification models. A test set
      of 500 reports was used to validate the model performance. Blinded manual review 
      of radiology reports by two independent physicians provided the reference
      standard. Each radiology report was segmented and word stem and bigram features
      were constructed. Common English "stop words" and rare features were excluded. We
      used 10-fold cross-validation to select optimal configuration parameters for each
      model. Accuracy, recall, precision and the F1 score were calculated. The final
      model was compared to the use of diagnosis codes for the identification of
      patients with long bone fractures. RESULTS: There were 329 unique word stems and 
      344 bigrams in the training documents. A support vector machine classifier with
      Gaussian kernel performed best on the test set with accuracy=0.958, recall=0.969,
      precision=0.940, and F1 score=0.954. Optimal parameters for this model were
      cost=4 and gamma=0.005. The three classification models that we tested all
      performed better than diagnosis codes in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1
      score (diagnosis code accuracy=0.932, recall=0.960, precision=0.896, and F1
      score=0.927). CONCLUSIONS: NLP methods using a corpus of 1,000 training documents
      accurately identified acute long bone fractures from radiology reports. Strategic
      use of straightforward NLP methods, implemented with freely available software,
      offers quality improvement teams new opportunities to extract information from
      narrative documents.

TI  - Data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs) for quality measurement of 
      the physical therapy process: comparison between EHR data and survey data.
PG  - 141
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the emergence of the electronic health records (EHRs) as a
      pervasive healthcare information technology, new opportunities and challenges for
      use of clinical data for quality measurements arise with respect to data quality,
      data availability and comparability. The objective of this study is to test
      whether data extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) was of comparable
      quality as survey data for the calculation of quality indicators. METHODS: Data
      from surveys describing patient cases and filled out by physiotherapists in
      2009-2010 were used to calculate scores on eight quality indicators (QIs) to
      measure the quality of physiotherapy care. In 2011, data was extracted directly
      from EHRs. The data collection methods were evaluated for comparability. EHR data
      was compared to survey data on completeness and correctness. RESULTS: Five of the
      eight QIs could be extracted from the EHRs. Three were omitted from the indicator
      set, as they proved too difficult to be extracted from the EHRs. Another QI
      proved incomparable due to errors in the extraction software of some of the EHRs.
      Three out of four comparable QIs performed better (p < 0.001) in EHR data on
      completeness. EHR data also proved to be correct; the relative change in
      indicator scores between EHR and survey data were small (<5 %) in three out of
      four QIs. CONCLUSION: Data quality of EHRs was sufficient to be used for the
      calculation of QIs, although comparability to survey data was problematic.
      Standardization is needed, not only to be able to compare different data
      collection methods properly, but also to compare between practices with different
      EHRs. EHRs have the option to administrate narrative data, but natural language
      processing tools are needed to quantify these text boxes. Such development, can
      narrow the comparability gap between scoring QIs based on EHR data and based on
      survey data. EHRs have the potential to provide real time feedback to
      professionals and quality measurements for research, but more effort is needed to
      create unambiguous and uniform information and to unlock written text in a
      standardized manner.

AB  - Ambiguity in the biomedical domain represents a major issue when performing
      Natural Language Processing tasks over the huge amount of available information
      in the field. For this reason, Word Sense Disambiguation is critical for
      achieving accurate systems able to tackle complex tasks such as information
      extraction, summarization or document classification. In this work we explore
      whether multilinguality can help to solve the problem of ambiguity, and the
      conditions required for a system to improve the results obtained by monolingual
      approaches. Also, we analyze the best ways to generate those useful multilingual 
      resources, and study different languages and sources of knowledge. The proposed
      system, based on co-occurrence graphs containing biomedical concepts and textual 
      information, is evaluated on a test dataset frequently used in biomedicine. We
      can conclude that multilingual resources are able to provide a clear improvement 
      of more than 7% compared to monolingual approaches, for graphs built from a small
      number of documents. Also, empirical results show that automatically translated
      resources are a useful source of information for this particular task.

TI  - Identifying axial spondyloarthritis in electronic medical records of United
      States Veterans.
LID - 10.1002/acr.23140 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Large database research in axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) is limited 
      by a lack of methods for identifying most types of AxSpA. Our objective was to
      develop methods for identifying AxSpA concepts in the free text of documents from
      electronic medical records. METHODS: Veterans with documents in the national
      Veteran Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse between January 1, 2005
      and June 30, 2015 were included. Methods were developed for exploring, selecting,
      and extracting meaningful terms that were likely to represent AxSpA concepts.
      With annotation, clinical experts reviewed sections of text containing the
      meaningful terms (snippets) and classified the snippets according to whether or
      not they represented the intended AxSpA concept. With natural language processing
      (NLP) tools, computers were trained to replicate the clinical experts' snippet
      classifications. RESULTS: Three AxSpA concepts were selected by clinical experts,
      including sacroiliitis, terms including the prefix spond*, and HLA-B27 positivity
      (HLA-B27+), and. With supervised machine learning on annotated snippets, NLP
      models were developed with accuracies of 91.1% for sacroiliitis, 93.5% for
      spond*, and 97.2% for HLA-B27+. With independent validation, the accuracies were 
      92.0% for sacroiliitis, 91.0% for spond*, and 99.0% for HLA-B27+. CONCLUSION: We 
      developed feasible and accurate methods for identifying AxSpA concepts in the
      free text of clinical notes. Additional research is required to determine
      combinations of concepts that will accurately identify AxSpA phenotypes. These
      novel methods will facilitate previously impractical observational research in
      AxSpA and may be applied to research with other diseases. This article is

TI  - Evaluating semantic similarity between Chinese biomedical terms through multiple 
      ontologies with score normalization: An initial study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Semantic similarity estimation significantly promotes the
      understanding of natural language resources and supports medical decision making.
      Previous studies have investigated semantic similarity and relatedness estimation
      between biomedical terms through resources in English, such as SNOMED-CT or UMLS.
      However, very limited studies focused on the Chinese language, and technology on 
      natural language processing and text mining of medical documents in China is
      urgently needed. Due to the lack of a complete and publicly available biomedical 
      ontology in China, we only have access to several modest-sized ontologies with no
      overlaps. Although all these ontologies do not constitute a complete coverage of 
      biomedicine, their coverage of their respective domains is acceptable. In this
      paper, semantic similarity estimations between Chinese biomedical terms using
      these multiple non-overlapping ontologies were explored as an initial study.
      METHODS: Typical path-based and information content (IC)-based similarity
      measures were applied on these ontologies. From the analysis of the computed
      similarity scores, heterogeneity in the statistical distributions of scores
      derived from multiple ontologies was discovered. This heterogeneity hampers the
      comparability of scores and the overall accuracy of similarity estimation. This
      problem was addressed through a novel language-independent method by combining
      semantic similarity estimation and score normalization. A reference standard was 
      also created in this study. RESULTS: Compared with the existing task-independent 
      normalization methods, the newly developed method exhibited superior performance 
      on most IC-based similarity measures. The accuracy of semantic similarity
      estimation was enhanced through score normalization. This enhancement resulted
      from the mitigation of heterogeneity in the similarity scores derived from
      multiple ontologies. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the potential necessity of score
      normalization when estimating semantic similarity using ontology-based measures. 
      The results of this study can also be extended to other language systems to
      implement semantic similarity estimation in biomedicine.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to develop a methodology to assess this risk 
      based on experimental tests versus numerical predictive head injury simulations. 
      A total of 16 non-lethal projectiles (NLP) impacts were conducted with rigid
      force plate at three different ranges of impact velocity (120, 72 and 55m/s) and 
      the force/deformation-time data were used for the validation of finite element
      (FE) NLP. A good accordance between experimental and simulation data were
      obtained during validation of FE NLP with high correlation value (>0.98) and peak
      force discrepancy of less than 3%. A state-of-the art finite element head model
      with enhanced brain and skull material laws and specific head injury criteria was
      used for numerical computation of NLP impacts. Frontal and lateral FE NLP impacts
      to the head model at different velocities were performed under LS-DYNA. It is the
      very first time that the lethality of NLP is assessed by axonal strain
      computation to predict diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in NLP impacts to head. In
      case of temporo-parietal impact the min-max risk of DAI is 0-86%. With a velocity
      above 99.2m/s there is greater than 50% risk of DAI for temporo-parietal impacts.
      All the medium- and high-velocity impacts are susceptible to skull fracture, with
      a percentage risk higher than 90%. This study provides tool for a realistic
      injury (DAI and skull fracture) assessment during NLP impacts to the human head.

TI  - Text Mining for Precision Medicine: Bringing Structure to EHRs and Biomedical
      Literature to Understand Genes and Health.
PG  - 139-166
AB  - The key question of precision medicine is whether it is possible to find
      clinically actionable granularity in diagnosing disease and classifying patient
      risk. The advent of next-generation sequencing and the widespread adoption of
      electronic health records (EHRs) have provided clinicians and researchers a
      wealth of data and made possible the precise characterization of individual
      patient genotypes and phenotypes. Unstructured text-found in biomedical
      publications and clinical notes-is an important component of genotype and
      phenotype knowledge. Publications in the biomedical literature provide essential 
      information for interpreting genetic data. Likewise, clinical notes contain the
      richest source of phenotype information in EHRs. Text mining can render these
      texts computationally accessible and support information extraction and
      hypothesis generation. This chapter reviews the mechanics of text mining in
      precision medicine and discusses several specific use cases, including database
      curation for personalized cancer medicine, patient outcome prediction from
      EHR-derived cohorts, and pharmacogenomic research. Taken as a whole, these use
      cases demonstrate how text mining enables effective utilization of existing
      knowledge sources and thus promotes increased value for patients and healthcare
      systems. Text mining is an indispensable tool for translating genotype-phenotype 
      data into effective clinical care that will undoubtedly play an important role in
      the eventual realization of precision medicine.

TI  - Natural Language Processing-Enabled and Conventional Data Capture Methods for
      Input to Electronic Health Records: A Comparative Usability Study.
PG  - e35
AB  - BACKGROUND: The process of documentation in electronic health records (EHRs) is
      known to be time consuming, inefficient, and cumbersome. The use of dictation
      coupled with manual transcription has become an increasingly common practice. In 
      recent years, natural language processing (NLP)-enabled data capture has become a
      viable alternative for data entry. It enables the clinician to maintain control
      of the process and potentially reduce the documentation burden. The question
      remains how this NLP-enabled workflow will impact EHR usability and whether it
      can meet the structured data and other EHR requirements while enhancing the
      user's experience. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is evaluate the
      comparative effectiveness of an NLP-enabled data capture method using dictation
      and data extraction from transcribed documents (NLP Entry) in terms of
      documentation time, documentation quality, and usability versus standard EHR
      keyboard-and-mouse data entry. METHODS: This formative study investigated the
      results of using 4 combinations of NLP Entry and Standard Entry methods
      ("protocols") of EHR data capture. We compared a novel dictation-based protocol
      using MediSapien NLP (NLP-NLP) for structured data capture against a standard
      structured data capture protocol (Standard-Standard) as well as 2 novel hybrid
      protocols (NLP-Standard and Standard-NLP). The 31 participants included
      neurologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists. Participants generated 4
      consultation or admission notes using 4 documentation protocols. We recorded the 
      time on task, documentation quality (using the Physician Documentation Quality
      Instrument, PDQI-9), and usability of the documentation processes. RESULTS: A
      total of 118 notes were documented across the 3 subject areas. The NLP-NLP
      protocol required a median of 5.2 minutes per cardiology note, 7.3 minutes per
      nephrology note, and 8.5 minutes per neurology note compared with 16.9, 20.7, and
      21.2 minutes, respectively, using the Standard-Standard protocol and 13.8, 21.3, 
      and 18.7 minutes using the Standard-NLP protocol (1 of 2 hybrid methods). Using 8
      out of 9 characteristics measured by the PDQI-9 instrument, the NLP-NLP protocol 
      received a median quality score sum of 24.5; the Standard-Standard protocol
      received a median sum of 29; and the Standard-NLP protocol received a median sum 
      of 29.5. The mean total score of the usability measure was 36.7 when the
      participants used the NLP-NLP protocol compared with 30.3 when they used the
      Standard-Standard protocol. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the feasibility of an
      approach to EHR data capture involving the application of NLP to transcribed
      dictation was demonstrated. This novel dictation-based approach has the potential
      to reduce the time required for documentation and improve usability while
      maintaining documentation quality. Future research will evaluate the NLP-based
      EHR data capture approach in a clinical setting. It is reasonable to assert that 
      EHRs will increasingly use NLP-enabled data entry tools such as MediSapien NLP
      because they hold promise for enhancing the documentation process and end-user
      experience.

AB  - The targeted design of nanoparticles for efficient drug loading and defined
      release profiles is even after 25years of research on lipid-based nanoparticles
      still no routine procedure. It requires detailed knowledge about the interaction 
      of the drug with the lipid compounds and about its localisation and distribution 
      in the nanoparticle. We present here an investigation on nano-sized lipid
      particles (NLP) composed of Gelucire and Witepsol as solid lipids, and Capryol as
      liquid lipid, loaded with Dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid used in topical
      treatment of inflammatory dermal diseases. The interactions of Dexamethasone,
      which was spin-labelled by 3-(Carboxy)-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy
      (DxPCA), with its microenvironment are monitored by EPR spectroscopy at 94GHz at 
      low temperatures. The mobility of the spin-labelled drug was probed by X-band EPR
      at room temperature. In order to relate the magnetic and dynamic parameters
      deduced from EPR to the local environment of the spin probe in the NLP,
      investigations of DxPCA in the individual lipid compounds were carried out. The
      magnetic parameters reflecting the polarity of DxPCA's environment as well as the
      parameters describing the mobility of the drug reveal that in the case of
      colloidal dispersions of the lipids and also the NLP DxPCA is attached to the
      surface of the nanoparticles. Although the lipophilic drug is almost exclusively 
      associated with the NLP in aqueous solution, dilution experiments show, that it
      can be easily released from the nanoparticle.

TI  - Combining natural language processing and network analysis to examine how
      advocacy organizations stimulate conversation on social media.
PG  - 11823-11828
AB  - Social media sites are rapidly becoming one of the most important forums for
      public deliberation about advocacy issues. However, social scientists have not
      explained why some advocacy organizations produce social media messages that
      inspire far-ranging conversation among social media users, whereas the vast
      majority of them receive little or no attention. I argue that advocacy
      organizations are more likely to inspire comments from new social media audiences
      if they create "cultural bridges," or produce messages that combine
      conversational themes within an advocacy field that are seldom discussed
      together. I use natural language processing, network analysis, and a social media
      application to analyze how cultural bridges shaped public discourse about autism 
      spectrum disorders on Facebook over the course of 1.5 years, controlling for
      various characteristics of advocacy organizations, their social media audiences, 
      and the broader social context in which they interact. I show that organizations 
      that create substantial cultural bridges provoke 2.52 times more comments about
      their messages from new social media users than those that do not, controlling
      for these factors. This study thus offers a theory of cultural messaging and
      public deliberation and computational techniques for text analysis and
      application-based survey research.

LID - 10.1038/sdata.2016.92 [doi]
AB  - Here we present an update of the studyforrest (http://studyforrest.org) dataset
      that complements the previously released functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) data for natural language processing with a new two-hour 3 Tesla fMRI
      acquisition while 15 of the original participants were shown an audio-visual
      version of the stimulus motion picture. We demonstrate with two validation
      analyses that these new data support modeling specific properties of the complex 
      natural stimulus, as well as a substantial within-subject BOLD response
      congruency in brain areas related to the processing of auditory inputs, speech,
      and narrative when compared to the existing fMRI data for audio-only stimulation.
      In addition, we provide participants' eye gaze location as recorded
      simultaneously with fMRI, and an additional sample of 15 control participants
      whose eye gaze trajectories for the entire movie were recorded in a lab
      setting-to enable studies on attentional processes and comparative investigations
      on the potential impact of the stimulation setting on these processes.

TI  - Psoriasis-Specific RNA Isoforms Identified by RNA-Seq Analysis of 173,446
      Transcripts.
PG  - 46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have been published that investigated potential links
      between transcriptome changes and psoriasis using microarrays and RNA-seq
      technologies, but no previous study has analyzed expression profile of
      alternatively spliced transcripts in psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: Identification of
      potential alternatively spliced RNA isoforms with disease-specific expression
      profile. METHODS: Using our published RNA sequencing data from lesional psoriatic
      (LP), non-lesional psoriatic (NLP), and normal control skin (C), we analyzed the 
      differential expression of RNA splicing variants. LP sample was compared with
      NLP, as was LP with C and NLP with C. RESULTS: Transcript-based annotation
      analyzed 173,446 transcripts (RNA isoforms), and around 9,000 transcripts were
      identified as differentially expressed between study groups. Several previously
      undescribed RNA variants were found. For instance, transcript ETV3_3
      (ENST00000326786) was significantly downregulated in LP and NLP skin. ETV3 is a
      transcriptional repressor that contributes to the downstream anti-inflammatory
      effects of IL-10. We also identified diseases-specific transcripts (S100A7A,
      IL36RN_4, and IL36G_3) of genes already recognized to be involved in inflammation
      and immune response. CONCLUSION: Psoriasis is characterized by significant
      differences in the expression of RNA alternative isoforms. Description of these
      new isoforms improves our knowledge about this complex disease.

AB  - In the era of digitalization, information retrieval (IR), which retrieves and
      ranks documents from large collections according to users' search queries, has
      been popularly applied in the biomedical domain. Building patient cohorts using
      electronic health records (EHRs) and searching literature for topics of interest 
      are some IR use cases. Meanwhile, natural language processing (NLP), such as
      tokenization or Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging, has been developed for processing
      clinical documents or biomedical literature. We hypothesize that NLP can be
      incorporated into IR to strengthen the conventional IR models. In this study, we 
      propose two NLP-empowered IR models, POS-BoW and POS-MRF, which incorporate
      automatic POS-based term weighting schemes into bag-of-word (BoW) and Markov
      Random Field (MRF) IR models, respectively. In the proposed models, the POS-based
      term weights are iteratively calculated by utilizing a cyclic coordinate method
      where golden section line search algorithm is applied along each coordinate to
      optimize the objective function defined by mean average precision (MAP). In the
      empirical experiments, we used the data sets from the Medical Records track in
      Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 2011 and 2012 and the Genomics track in TREC
      2004. The evaluation on TREC 2011 and 2012 Medical Records tracks shows that, for
      the POS-BoW models, the mean improvement rates for IR evaluation metrics, MAP,
      bpref, and P@10, are 10.88%, 4.54%, and 3.82%, compared to the BoW models; and
      for the POS-MRF models, these rates are 13.59%, 8.20%, and 8.78%, compared to the
      MRF models. Additionally, we experimentally verify that the proposed weighting
      approach is superior to the simple heuristic and frequency based weighting
      approaches, and validate our POS category selection. Using the optimal weights
      calculated in this experiment, we tested the proposed models on the TREC 2004
      Genomics track and obtained average of 8.63% and 10.04% improvement rates for
      POS-BoW and POS-MRF, respectively. These significant improvements verify the
      effectiveness of leveraging POS tagging for biomedical IR tasks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Constructing standard and computable clinical diagnostic criteria is 
      an important but challenging research field in the clinical informatics
      community. The Quality Data Model (QDM) is emerging as a promising information
      model for standardizing clinical diagnostic criteria. OBJECTIVE: To develop and
      evaluate automated methods for converting textual clinical diagnostic criteria in
      a structured format using QDM. METHODS: We used a clinical Natural Language
      Processing (NLP) tool known as cTAKES to detect sentences and annotate events in 
      diagnostic criteria. We developed a rule-based approach for assigning the QDM
      datatype(s) to an individual criterion, whereas we invoked a machine learning
      algorithm based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for annotating attributes
      belonging to each particular QDM datatype. We manually developed an annotated
      corpus as the gold standard and used standard measures (precision, recall and
      f-measure) for the performance evaluation. RESULTS: We harvested 267 individual
      criteria with the datatypes of Symptom and Laboratory Test from 63 textual
      diagnostic criteria. We manually annotated attributes and values in 142
      individual Laboratory Test criteria. The average performance of our rule-based
      approach was 0.84 of precision, 0.86 of recall, and 0.85 of f-measure; the
      performance of CRFs-based classification was 0.95 of precision, 0.88 of recall
      and 0.91 of f-measure. We also implemented a web-based tool that automatically
      translates textual Laboratory Test criteria into the QDM XML template format. The
      results indicated that our approaches leveraging cTAKES and CRFs are effective in
      facilitating diagnostic criteria annotation and classification. CONCLUSION: Our
      NLP-based computational framework is a feasible and useful solution in developing
      diagnostic criteria representation and computerization.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: It has become regular practice to de-identify unstructured medical
      text for use in research using automatic methods, the goal of which is to remove 
      patient identifying information to minimize re-identification risk. The metrics
      commonly used to determine if these systems are performing well do not accurately
      reflect the risk of a patient being re-identified. We therefore developed a
      framework for measuring the risk of re-identification associated with textual
      data releases. METHODS: We apply the proposed evaluation framework to a data set 
      from the University of Michigan Medical School. Our risk assessment results are
      then compared with those that would be obtained using a typical contemporary
      micro-average evaluation of recall in order to illustrate the difference between 
      the proposed evaluation framework and the current baseline method. RESULTS: We
      demonstrate how this framework compares against common measures of the
      re-identification risk associated with an automated text de-identification
      process. For the probability of re-identification using our evaluation framework 
      we obtained a mean value for direct identifiers of 0.0074 and a mean value for
      quasi-identifiers of 0.0022. The 95% confidence interval for these estimates were
      below the relevant thresholds. The threshold for direct identifier risk was based
      on previously used approaches in the literature. The threshold for
      quasi-identifiers was determined based on the context of the data release
      following commonly used de-identification criteria for structured data.
      DISCUSSION: Our framework attempts to correct for poorly distributed evaluation
      corpora, accounts for the data release context, and avoids the often optimistic
      assumptions that are made using the more traditional evaluation approach. It
      therefore provides a more realistic estimate of the true probability of
      re-identification. CONCLUSIONS: This framework should be used as a basis for
      computing re-identification risk in order to more realistically evaluate future
      text de-identification tools.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate whether volar locking plate was superior
      over non-locking plate in the treatment of die-punch fractures of the distal
      radius. METHODS: A total of 57 patients with closed die-punch fractures of the
      distal radius were included and analyzed. Of them, 32 were treated by non-locking
      plate (NLP) and the remaining 25 were treated by volar locking plate (VLP).
      Preoperative radiographs, computer tomographs and three-dimensional
      reconstruction, radiographs taken at immediate postoperation and at last
      follow-up were extracted and evaluated. Patients' electronic medical records were
      inquired and related demographic and medical data were documented. The documented
      contents were volar tilt, radial inclination, ulnar variance, grip strength,
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and visual analog scale (VAS) 
      scores and complications. RESULTS: VLP group demonstrated a significantly reduced
      radial subsidence of 1.5 mm (0.7 versus 2.2 mm), during the interval of bony
      union (P < 0.001), compared to NLP group. Larger proportion of patients (88%
      versus 62.5%) in VLP group gained acceptable joint congruity (step-off <2 mm) at 
      the final follow-up (P = 0.037). No significant differences were observed between
      the groups in the measurements of volar tilt, radial inclination, DASH, VAS and
      grip strength recovery at the last follow-up. There was a trend of fewer overall 
      complications (5/25 versus 10/32) and major complications that required surgery
      interventions (1/25 versus 4/32) in VLP than NLP groups, although the difference 
      did not approach to significance (P = 0.339, 0.372). CONCLUSIONS: VLP leaded to
      significantly better results of reduction maintainance and the final joint
      congruity than NLP, while reducing overall and major complications. However, the 
      results should be treated in the context of limitations and the clinical
      significance of the difference required further studies to investigate.

      Risk Using Cyber Informatics.
PG  - 557-560
AB  - Openly available online sources can be very valuable for executing in silico
      case-control epidemiological studies. Adjustment of confounding factors to
      isolate the association between an observing factor and disease is essential for 
      such studies. However, such information is not always readily available online.
      This paper suggests natural language processing methods for extracting
      socio-demographic information from content openly available online. Feasibility
      of the suggested method is demonstrated by performing a case-control study
      focusing on the association between age, gender, and income level and lung cancer
      risk. The study shows stronger association between older age and lower
      socioeconomic status and higher lung cancer risk, which is consistent with the
      findings reported in traditional cancer epidemiology studies.

TI  - Predicting early psychiatric readmission with natural language processing of
      narrative discharge summaries.
PG  - e921
LID - 10.1038/tp.2015.182 [doi]
AB  - The ability to predict psychiatric readmission would facilitate the development
      of interventions to reduce this risk, a major driver of psychiatric health-care
      costs. The symptoms or characteristics of illness course necessary to develop
      reliable predictors are not available in coded billing data, but may be present
      in narrative electronic health record (EHR) discharge summaries. We identified a 
      cohort of individuals admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 1994 and
      2012 with a principal diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and extracted
      inpatient psychiatric discharge narrative notes. Using these data, we trained a
      75-topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a form of natural language
      processing, which identifies groups of words associated with topics discussed in 
      a document collection. The cohort was randomly split to derive a training (70%)
      and testing (30%) data set, and we trained separate support vector machine models
      for baseline clinical features alone, baseline features plus common individual
      words and the above plus topics identified from the 75-topic LDA model. Of 4687
      patients with inpatient discharge summaries, 470 were readmitted within 30 days. 
      The 75-topic LDA model included topics linked to psychiatric symptoms (suicide,
      severe depression, anxiety, trauma, eating/weight and panic) and major depressive
      disorder comorbidities (infection, postpartum, brain tumor, diarrhea and
      pulmonary disease). By including LDA topics, prediction of readmission, as
      measured by area under receiver-operating characteristic curves in the testing
      data set, was improved from baseline (area under the curve 0.618) to
      baseline+1000 words (0.682) to baseline+75 topics (0.784). Inclusion of topics
      derived from narrative notes allows more accurate discrimination of individuals
      at high risk for psychiatric readmission in this cohort. Topic modeling and
      related approaches offer the potential to improve prediction using EHRs, if
      generalizability can be established in other clinical cohorts.

TI  - Novel Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Predict Suicidal Ideation and
      Psychiatric Symptoms in a Text-Based Mental Health Intervention in Madrid.
PG  - 8708434
AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning were used to predict
      suicidal ideation and heightened psychiatric symptoms among adults recently
      discharged from psychiatric inpatient or emergency room settings in Madrid,
      Spain. Participants responded to structured mental and physical health
      instruments at multiple follow-up points. Outcome variables of interest were
      suicidal ideation and psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12). Predictor variables included
      structured items (e.g., relating to sleep and well-being) and responses to one
      unstructured question, "how do you feel today?" We compared NLP-based models
      using the unstructured question with logistic regression prediction models using 
      structured data. The PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for NLP-based models of
      suicidal ideation were 0.61, 0.56, and 0.57, respectively, compared to 0.73,
      0.76, and 0.62 of structured data-based models. The PPV, sensitivity, and
      specificity for NLP-based models of heightened psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12 >/=
      4) were 0.56, 0.59, and 0.60, respectively, compared to 0.79, 0.79, and 0.85 in
      structured models. NLP-based models were able to generate relatively high
      predictive values based solely on responses to a simple general mood question.
      These models have promise for rapidly identifying persons at risk of suicide or
      psychological distress and could provide a low-cost screening alternative in
      settings where lengthy structured item surveys are not feasible.

TI  - Extracting PICO Sentences from Clinical Trial Reports using Supervised Distant
      Supervision.
LID - 132 [pii]
AB  - Systematic reviews underpin Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) by addressing precise
      clinical questions via comprehensive synthesis of all relevant published
      evidence. Authors of systematic reviews typically define a Population/Problem,
      Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (a PICO criteria) of interest, and then
      retrieve, appraise and synthesize results from all reports of clinical trials
      that meet these criteria. Identifying PICO elements in the full-texts of trial
      reports is thus a critical yet time-consuming step in the systematic review
      process. We seek to expedite evidence synthesis by developing machine learning
      models to automatically extract sentences from articles relevant to PICO
      elements. Collecting a large corpus of training data for this task would be
      prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we derive distant supervision (DS) with which
      to train models using previously conducted reviews. DS entails heuristically
      deriving 'soft' labels from an available structured resource. However, we have
      access only to unstructured, free-text summaries of PICO elements for
      corresponding articles; we must derive from these the desired sentence-level
      annotations. To this end, we propose a novel method - supervised distant
      supervision (SDS) - that uses a small amount of direct supervision to better
      exploit a large corpus of distantly labeled instances by learning to
      pseudo-annotate articles using the available DS. We show that this approach tends
      to outperform existing methods with respect to automated PICO extraction.

      records of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - AIMS: Accurate measures of hypoglycemia within electronic health records (EHR)
      can facilitate clinical population management and research. We quantify the
      occurrence of serious and mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia in a large EHR database
      in the US, comparing estimates based only on structured data to those from
      structured data and natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes. METHODS:
      This cohort study included patients with type 2 diabetes identified from January 
      2009 through March 2014. We compared estimates of occurrence of hypoglycemia
      derived from diagnostic codes to those recorded within clinical notes and
      classified via NLP. Measures of hypoglycemia from only structured data (ICD-9
      Algorithm), only note mentions (NLP Algorithm), and either structured data or
      notes (Combined Algorithm) were compared with estimates of the period prevalence,
      incidence rate, and event rate of hypoglycemia, overall and by seriousness.
      RESULTS: Of the 844,683 eligible patients, 119,695 had at least one recorded
      hypoglycemic event identified with ICD-9 or NLP. The period prevalence of
      hypoglycemia was 12.4%, 25.1%, and 32.2% for the ICD-9 Algorithm, NLP Algorithm, 
      and Combined Algorithm, respectively. There were 6128 apparent non-serious events
      utilizing the ICD-9 Algorithm, which increased to 152,987 non-serious events
      within the Combined Algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: Ascertainment of events from clinical
      notes more than doubled the completeness of hypoglycemia capture overall relative
      to measures from structured data, and increased capture of non-serious events
      more than 20-fold. The structured data and clinical notes are complementary
      within the EHR, and both need to be considered in order to fully assess the
      occurrence of hypoglycemia.

TI  - Text mining electronic hospital records to automatically classify admissions

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Text and data mining play an important role in obtaining insights from
      Health and Hospital Information Systems. This paper presents a text mining system
      for detecting admissions marked as positive for several diseases: Lung Cancer,
      Breast Cancer, Colon Cancer, Secondary Malignant Neoplasm of Respiratory and
      Digestive Organs, Multiple Myeloma and Malignant Plasma Cell Neoplasms,
      Pneumonia, and Pulmonary Embolism. We specifically examine the effect of linking 
      multiple data sources on text classification performance. METHODS: Support Vector
      Machine classifiers are built for eight data source combinations, and evaluated
      using the metrics of Precision, Recall and F-Score. Sub-sampling techniques are
      used to address unbalanced datasets of medical records. We use radiology reports 
      as an initial data source and add other sources, such as pathology reports and
      patient and hospital admission data, in order to assess the research question
      regarding the impact of the value of multiple data sources. Statistical
      significance is measured using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A second set of
      experiments explores aspects of the system in greater depth, focusing on Lung
      Cancer. We explore the impact of feature selection; analyse the learning curve;
      examine the effect of restricting admissions to only those containing reports
      from all data sources; and examine the impact of reducing the sub-sampling. These
      experiments provide better understanding of how to best apply text classification
      in the context of imbalanced data of variable completeness. RESULTS: Radiology
      questions plus patient and hospital admission data contribute valuable
      information for detecting most of the diseases, significantly improving
      performance when added to radiology reports alone or to the combination of
      radiology and pathology reports. CONCLUSION: Overall, linking data sources
      significantly improved classification performance for all the diseases examined. 
      However, there is no single approach that suits all scenarios; the choice of the 
      most effective combination of data sources depends on the specific disease to be 
      classified.

TI  - Grammaticality, Acceptability, and Probability: A Probabilistic View of
      Linguistic Knowledge.
LID - 10.1111/cogs.12414 [doi]
AB  - The question of whether humans represent grammatical knowledge as a binary
      condition on membership in a set of well-formed sentences, or as a probabilistic 
      property has been the subject of debate among linguists, psychologists, and
      cognitive scientists for many decades. Acceptability judgments present a serious 
      problem for both classical binary and probabilistic theories of grammaticality.
      These judgements are gradient in nature, and so cannot be directly accommodated
      in a binary formal grammar. However, it is also not possible to simply reduce
      acceptability to probability. The acceptability of a sentence is not the same as 
      the likelihood of its occurrence, which is, in part, determined by factors like
      sentence length and lexical frequency. In this paper, we present the results of a
      set of large-scale experiments using crowd-sourced acceptability judgments that
      demonstrate gradience to be a pervasive feature in acceptability judgments. We
      then show how one can predict acceptability judgments on the basis of probability
      by augmenting probabilistic language models with an acceptability measure. This
      is a function that normalizes probability values to eliminate the confounding
      factors of length and lexical frequency. We describe a sequence of modeling
      experiments with unsupervised language models drawn from state-of-the-art machine
      learning methods in natural language processing. Several of these models achieve 
      very encouraging levels of accuracy in the acceptability prediction task, as
      measured by the correlation between the acceptability measure scores and mean
      human acceptability values. We consider the relevance of these results to the
      debate on the nature of grammatical competence, and we argue that they support
      the view that linguistic knowledge can be intrinsically probabilistic.

TI  - IBM Watson Analytics: Automating Visualization, Descriptive, and Predictive
      Statistics.
PG  - e157
AB  - BACKGROUND: We live in an era of explosive data generation that will continue to 
      grow and involve all industries. One of the results of this explosion is the need
      for newer and more efficient data analytics procedures. Traditionally, data
      analytics required a substantial background in statistics and computer science.
      In 2015, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) released the IBM
      Watson Analytics (IBMWA) software that delivered advanced statistical procedures 
      based on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The latest entry
      of Watson Analytics into the field of analytical software products provides users
      with enhanced functions that are not available in many existing programs. For
      example, Watson Analytics automatically analyzes datasets, examines data quality,
      and determines the optimal statistical approach. Users can request exploratory,
      predictive, and visual analytics. Using natural language processing (NLP), users 
      are able to submit additional questions for analyses in a quick response format. 
      This analytical package is available free to academic institutions (faculty and
      students) that plan to use the tools for noncommercial purposes. OBJECTIVE: To
      report the features of IBMWA and discuss how this software subjectively and
      objectively compares to other data mining programs. METHODS: The salient features
      of the IBMWA program were examined and compared with other common analytical
      platforms, using validated health datasets. RESULTS: Using a validated dataset,
      IBMWA delivered similar predictions compared with several commercial and open
      source data mining software applications. The visual analytics generated by IBMWA
      were similar to results from programs such as Microsoft Excel and Tableau
      Software. In addition, assistance with data preprocessing and data exploration
      was an inherent component of the IBMWA application. Sensitivity and specificity
      were not included in the IBMWA predictive analytics results, nor were odds
      ratios, confidence intervals, or a confusion matrix. CONCLUSIONS: IBMWA is a new 
      alternative for data analytics software that automates descriptive, predictive,
      and visual analytics. This program is very user-friendly but requires data
      preprocessing, statistical conceptual understanding, and domain expertise.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaphoric references occur ubiquitously in clinical narrative text.
      However, the problem, still very much an open challenge, is typically less
      aggressively focused on in clinical text domain applications. Furthermore,
      existing research on reference resolution is often conducted disjointly from
      real-world motivating tasks. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present our
      machine-learning system that automatically performs reference resolution and a
      rule-based system to extract tumor characteristics, with component-based and
      end-to-end evaluations. Specifically, our goal was to build an algorithm that
      takes in tumor templates and outputs tumor characteristic, e.g. tumor number and 
      largest tumor sizes, necessary for identifying patient liver cancer stage
      phenotypes. RESULTS: Our reference resolution system reached a modest performance
      of 0.66 F1 for the averaged MUC, B-cubed, and CEAF scores for coreference
      resolution and 0.43 F1 for particularization relations. However, even this modest
      performance was helpful to increase the automatic tumor characteristics
      annotation substantially over no reference resolution. CONCLUSION: Experiments
      revealed the benefit of reference resolution even for relatively simple tumor
      characteristics variables such as largest tumor size. However we found that
      different overall variables had different tolerances to reference resolution
      upstream errors, highlighting the need to characterize systems by end-to-end
      evaluations.

TI  - Automated Neuroanatomical Relation Extraction: A Linguistically Motivated
      Approach with a PVT Connectivity Graph Case Study.
PG  - 39
AB  - Identifying the relations among different regions of the brain is vital for a
      better understanding of how the brain functions. While a large number of studies 
      have investigated the neuroanatomical and neurochemical connections among brain
      structures, their specific findings are found in publications scattered over a
      large number of years and different types of publications. Text mining techniques
      have provided the means to extract specific types of information from a large
      number of publications with the aim of presenting a larger, if not necessarily an
      exhaustive picture. By using natural language processing techniques, the present 
      paper aims to identify connectivity relations among brain regions in general and 
      relations relevant to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in
      particular. We introduce a linguistically motivated approach based on patterns
      defined over the constituency and dependency parse trees of sentences. Besides
      the presence of a relation between a pair of brain regions, the proposed method
      also identifies the directionality of the relation, which enables the creation
      and analysis of a directional brain region connectivity graph. The approach is
      evaluated over the manually annotated data sets of the WhiteText Project. In
      addition, as a case study, the method is applied to extract and analyze the
      connectivity graph of PVT, which is an important brain region that is considered 
      to influence many functions ranging from arousal, motivation, and drug-seeking
      behavior to attention. The results of the PVT connectivity graph show that PVT
      may be a new target of research in mood assessment.

TI  - PubMedPortable: A Framework for Supporting the Development of Text Mining
      Applications.
PG  - e0163794
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0163794 [doi]
AB  - Information extraction from biomedical literature is continuously growing in
      scope and importance. Many tools exist that perform named entity recognition,
      e.g. of proteins, chemical compounds, and diseases. Furthermore, several
      approaches deal with the extraction of relations between identified entities. The
      BioCreative community supports these developments with yearly open challenges,
      which led to a standardised XML text annotation format called BioC. PubMed
      provides access to the largest open biomedical literature repository, but there
      is no unified way of connecting its data to natural language processing tools.
      Therefore, an appropriate data environment is needed as a basis to combine
      different software solutions and to develop customised text mining applications. 
      PubMedPortable builds a relational database and a full text index on PubMed
      citations. It can be applied either to the complete PubMed data set or an
      arbitrary subset of downloaded PubMed XML files. The software provides the
      infrastructure to combine stand-alone applications by exporting different data
      formats, e.g. BioC. The presented workflows show how to use PubMedPortable to
      retrieve, store, and analyse a disease-specific data set. The provided use cases 
      are well documented in the PubMedPortable wiki. The open-source software library 
      is small, easy to use, and scalable to the user's system requirements. It is
      freely available for Linux on the web at
      https://github.com/KerstenDoering/PubMedPortable and for other operating systems 
      as a virtual container. The approach was tested extensively and applied
      successfully in several projects.

TI  - Modelling Creativity: Identifying Key Components through a Corpus-Based Approach.
PG  - e0162959
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0162959 [doi]
AB  - Creativity is a complex, multi-faceted concept encompassing a variety of related 
      aspects, abilities, properties and behaviours. If we wish to study creativity
      scientifically, then a tractable and well-articulated model of creativity is
      required. Such a model would be of great value to researchers investigating the
      nature of creativity and in particular, those concerned with the evaluation of
      creative practice. This paper describes a unique approach to developing a
      suitable model of how creative behaviour emerges that is based on the words
      people use to describe the concept. Using techniques from the field of
      statistical natural language processing, we identify a collection of fourteen key
      components of creativity through an analysis of a corpus of academic papers on
      the topic. Words are identified which appear significantly often in connection
      with discussions of the concept. Using a measure of lexical similarity to help
      cluster these words, a number of distinct themes emerge, which collectively
      contribute to a comprehensive and multi-perspective model of creativity. The
      components provide an ontology of creativity: a set of building blocks which can 
      be used to model creative practice in a variety of domains. The components have
      been employed in two case studies to evaluate the creativity of computational
      systems and have proven useful in articulating achievements of this work and
      directions for further research.

TI  - Moving Beyond Readability Metrics for Health-Related Text Simplification.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Limited health literacy is a barrier to understanding health information.
      Simplifying text can reduce this barrier and possibly other known disparities in 
      health. Unfortunately, few tools exist to simplify text with demonstrated impact 
      on comprehension. By leveraging modern data sources integrated with natural
      language processing algorithms, we are developing the first semi-automated text
      simplification tool. We present two main contributions. First, we introduce our
      evidence-based development strategy for designing effective text simplification
      software and summarize initial, promising results. Second, we present a new study
      examining existing readability formulas, which are the most commonly used tools
      for text simplification in healthcare. We compare syllable count, the proxy for
      word difficulty used by most readability formulas, with our new metric 'term
      familiarity' and find that syllable count measures how difficult words 'appear'
      to be, but not their actual difficulty. In contrast, term familiarity can be used
      to measure actual difficulty.

TI  - Enhancing Extraction of Drug-Drug Interaction from Literature Using Neutral
      Candidates, Negation, and Clause Dependency.
PG  - e0163480
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0163480 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Supervised biomedical relation extraction plays an important role in 
      biomedical natural language processing, endeavoring to obtain the relations
      between biomedical entities. Drug-drug interactions, which are investigated in
      the present paper, are notably among the critical biomedical relations. Thus far 
      many methods have been developed with the aim of extracting DDI relations.
      However, unfortunately there has been a scarcity of comprehensive studies on the 
      effects of negation, complex sentences, clause dependency, and neutral candidates
      in the course of DDI extraction from biomedical articles. RESULTS: Our study
      proposes clause dependency features and a number of features for identifying
      neutral candidates as well as negation cues and scopes. Furthermore, our
      experiments indicate that the proposed features significantly improve the
      performance of the relation extraction task combined with other kernel methods.
      We characterize the contribution of each category of features and finally
      conclude that neutral candidate features have the most prominent role among all
      of the three categories.

TI  - Yield of CT Pulmonary Angiography in the Emergency Department When Providers
      Override Evidence-based Clinical Decision Support.
PG  - 717-725
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2016151985 [doi]
AB  - Purpose To determine the frequency of, and yield after, provider overrides of
      evidence-based clinical decision support (CDS) for ordering computed tomographic 
      (CT) pulmonary angiography in the emergency department (ED). Materials and
      Methods This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study was
      performed at a tertiary care, academic medical center ED with approximately 60
      000 annual visits and included all patients who were suspected of having
      pulmonary embolism (PE) and who underwent CT pulmonary angiography between
      January 1, 2011, and August 31, 2013. The requirement to obtain informed consent 
      was waived. Each CT order for pulmonary angiography was exposed to CDS on the
      basis of the Wells criteria. For patients with a Wells score of 4 or less, CDS
      alerts suggested d-dimer testing because acute PE is highly unlikely in these
      patients if d-dimer levels are normal. The yield of CT pulmonary angiography
      (number of positive PE diagnoses/total number of CT pulmonary angiographic
      examinations) was compared in patients in whom providers overrode CDS alerts (by 
      performing CT pulmonary angiography in patients with a Wells score </=4 and a
      normal d-dimer level or no d-dimer testing) (override group) and those in whom
      providers followed Wells criteria (CT pulmonary angiography only in patients with
      Wells score >4 or </=4 with elevated d-dimer level) (adherent group). A validated
      natural language processing tool identified positive PE diagnoses, with
      subsegmental and/or indeterminate diagnoses removed by means of chart review.
      Statistical analysis was performed with the chi2 test, the Student t test, and
      logistic regression. Results Among 2993 CT pulmonary angiography studies in 2655 
      patients, 563 examinations had a Wells score of 4 or less but did not undergo
      d-dimer testing and 26 had a Wells score of 4 or less and had normal d-dimer
      levels. The yield of CT pulmonary angiography was 4.2% in the override group (25 
      of 589 studies, none with a normal d-dimer level) and 11.2% in the adherent group
      (270 of 2404 studies) (P < .001). After adjustment for the risk factor
      differences between the two groups, the odds of an acute PE finding were 51.3%
      lower when providers overrode alerts than when they followed CDS guidelines.
      Comparison of the two groups including only patients unlikely to have PE led to
      similar results. Conclusion The odds of an acute PE finding in the ED when
      providers adhered to evidence presented in CDS were nearly double those seen when
      providers overrode CDS alerts. Most overrides were due to the lack of d-dimer
      testing in patients unlikely to have PE. (c) RSNA, 2016.

AB  - In September 2015 the EDM Forum hosted AcademyHealth's newest national
      conference, Concordium. The 11 papers featured in the eGEMs "Concordium 2015"
      special issue successfully reflect the major themes and issues discussed at the
      meeting. Many of the papers address informatics or methodological approaches to
      natural language processing (NLP) or text analysis, which is indicative of the
      importance of analyzing text data to gain insights into care coordination and
      patient-centered outcomes. Perspectives on the tools and infrastructure
      requirements that are needed to build learning health systems were also recurrent
      themes.

TI  - v3NLP Framework: Tools to Build Applications for Extracting Concepts from
      Clinical Text.
PG  - 1228
LID - 10.13063/2327-9214.1228 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Substantial amounts of clinically significant information are
      contained only within the narrative of the clinical notes in electronic medical
      records. The v3NLP Framework is a set of "best-of-breed" functionalities
      developed to transform this information into structured data for use in quality
      improvement, research, population health surveillance, and decision support.
      BACKGROUND: MetaMap, cTAKES and similar well-known natural language processing
      (NLP) tools do not have sufficient scalability out of the box. The v3NLP
      Framework evolved out of the necessity to scale-up these tools up and provide a
      framework to customize and tune techniques that fit a variety of tasks, including
      document classification, tuned concept extraction for specific conditions,
      patient classification, and information retrieval. INNOVATION: Beyond
      scalability, several v3NLP Framework-developed projects have been efficacy tested
      and benchmarked. While v3NLP Framework includes annotators, pipelines and
      applications, its functionalities enable developers to create novel annotators
      and to place annotators into pipelines and scaled applications. DISCUSSION: The
      v3NLP Framework has been successfully utilized in many projects including general
      concept extraction, risk factors for homelessness among veterans, and
      identification of mentions of the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter.
      Projects as diverse as predicting colonization with methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus and extracting references to military sexual trauma are
      being built using v3NLP Framework components. CONCLUSION: The v3NLP Framework is 
      a set of functionalities and components that provide Java developers with the
      ability to create novel annotators and to place those annotators into pipelines
      and applications to extract concepts from clinical text. There are scale-up and
      scale-out functionalities to process large numbers of records.

TI  - Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Algorithms to Automate the
      Evaluation of Clinical Decision Support in Electronic Medical Record Systems.
PG  - 1222
LID - 10.13063/2327-9214.1222 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: As the number of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs)
      incorporated into electronic medical records (EMRs) increases, so does the need
      to evaluate their effectiveness. The use of medical record review and similar
      manual methods for evaluating decision rules is laborious and inefficient. The
      authors use machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to 
      accurately evaluate a clinical decision support rule through an EMR system, and
      they compare it against manual evaluation. METHODS: Modeled after the EMR system 
      EPIC at Maine Medical Center, we developed a dummy data set containing physician 
      notes in free text for 3,621 artificial patients records undergoing a head
      computed tomography (CT) scan for mild traumatic brain injury after the
      incorporation of an electronic best practice approach. We validated the accuracy 
      of the Best Practice Advisories (BPA) using three machine learning
      algorithms-C-Support Vector Classification (SVC), Decision Tree Classifier
      (DecisionTreeClassifier), k-nearest neighbors classifier
      (KNeighborsClassifier)-by comparing their accuracy for adjudicating the
      occurrence of a mild traumatic brain injury against manual review. We then used
      the best of the three algorithms to evaluate the effectiveness of the BPA, and we
      compared the algorithm's evaluation of the BPA to that of manual review. RESULTS:
      The electronic best practice approach was found to have a sensitivity of 98.8
      percent (96.83-100.0), specificity of 10.3 percent, PPV = 7.3 percent, and NPV = 
      99.2 percent when reviewed manually by abstractors. Though all the machine
      learning algorithms were observed to have a high level of prediction, the SVC
      displayed the highest with a sensitivity 93.33 percent (92.49-98.84), specificity
      of 97.62 percent (96.53-98.38), PPV = 50.00, NPV = 99.83. The SVC algorithm was
      observed to have a sensitivity of 97.9 percent (94.7-99.86), specificity 10.30
      percent, PPV 7.25 percent, and NPV 99.2 percent for evaluating the best practice 
      approach, after accounting for 17 cases (0.66 percent) where the patient records 
      had to be reviewed manually due to the NPL systems inability to capture the
      proper diagnosis. DISCUSSION: CDSSs incorporated into EMRs can be evaluated in an
      automatic fashion by using NLP and machine learning techniques.

TI  - Rapid identification of familial hypercholesterolemia from electronic health
      records: The SEARCH study.

LID - 10.1016/j.jacl.2016.08.001 [doi]
LID - S1933-2874(16)30273-2 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about prevalence, awareness, and control of familial 
      hypercholesterolemia (FH) in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To address these
      knowledge gaps, we developed an ePhenotyping algorithm for rapid identification
      of FH in electronic health records (EHRs) and deployed it in the Screening
      Employees And Residents in the Community for Hypercholesterolemia (SEARCH) study.
      METHODS: We queried a database of 131,000 individuals seen between 1993 and 2014 
      in primary care practice to identify 5992 (mean age 52 +/- 13 years, 42% men)
      patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >/=190 mg/dL,
      triglycerides <400 mg/dL and without secondary causes of hyperlipidemia. RESULTS:
      Our EHR-based algorithm ascertained the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria for
      FH using structured data sets and natural language processing for family history 
      and presence of FH stigmata on physical examination. Blinded expert review
      revealed positive and negative predictive values for the SEARCH algorithm at 94% 
      and 97%, respectively. The algorithm identified 32 definite and 391 probable
      cases with an overall FH prevalence of 0.32% (1:310). Only 55% of the FH cases
      had a diagnosis code relevant to FH. Mean LDL-C at the time of FH ascertainment
      was 237 mg/dL; at follow-up, 70% (298 of 423) of patients were on lipid-lowering 
      treatment with 80% achieving an LDL-C </=100 mg/dL. Of treated FH patients with
      premature CHD, only 22% (48 of 221) achieved an LDL-C </=70 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS:
      In a primary care setting, we found the prevalence of FH to be 1:310 with low
      awareness and control. Further studies are needed to assess whether automated
      detection of FH in EHR improves patient outcomes.

TI  - Nematode Peptides with Host-Directed Anti-inflammatory Activity Rescue
      Caenorhabditis elegans from a Burkholderia pseudomallei Infection.
PG  - 1436
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01436 [doi]
AB  - Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is among a growing
      number of bacterial pathogens that are increasingly antibiotic resistant.
      Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been investigated as an alternative approach
      to treat microbial infections, as generally, there is a lower likelihood that a
      pathogen will develop resistance to AMPs. In this study, 36 candidate
      Caenorhabditis elegans genes that encode secreted peptides of <150 amino acids
      and previously shown to be overexpressed during infection by B. pseudomallei were
      identified from the expression profile of infected nematodes. RNA interference
      (RNAi)-based knockdown of 12/34 peptide-encoding genes resulted in enhanced
      nematode susceptibility to B. pseudomallei without affecting worm fitness. A
      microdilution test demonstrated that two peptides, NLP-31 and Y43C5A.3, exhibited
      anti-B. pseudomallei activity in a dose dependent manner on different pathogens. 
      Time kill analysis proposed that these peptides were bacteriostatic against B.
      pseudomallei at concentrations up to 8x MIC90. The SYTOX green assay demonstrated
      that NLP-31 and Y43C5A.3 did not disrupt the B. pseudomallei membrane. Instead,
      gel retardation assays revealed that both peptides were able to bind to DNA and
      interfere with bacterial viability. In parallel, microscopic examination showed
      induction of cellular filamentation, a hallmark of DNA synthesis inhibition, of
      NLP-31 and Y43C5A.3 treated cells. In addition, the peptides also regulated the
      expression of inflammatory cytokines in B. pseudomallei infected macrophage
      cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of NLP-31 and
      Y43C5A.3 as anti-B. pseudomallei peptides based on their function as immune
      modulators.

TI  - ChemDataExtractor: A Toolkit for Automated Extraction of Chemical Information
      from the Scientific Literature.
PG  - 1894-1904
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00207 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of "big data" initiatives has led to the need for tools that can
      automatically extract valuable chemical information from large volumes of
      unstructured data, such as the scientific literature. Since chemical information 
      can be present in figures, tables, and textual paragraphs, successful information
      extraction often depends on the ability to interpret all of these domains
      simultaneously. We present a complete toolkit for the automated extraction of
      chemical entities and their associated properties, measurements, and
      relationships from scientific documents that can be used to populate structured
      chemical databases. Our system provides an extensible, chemistry-aware, natural
      language processing pipeline for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named
      entity recognition, and phrase parsing. Within this scope, we report improved
      performance for chemical named entity recognition through the use of unsupervised
      word clustering based on a massive corpus of chemistry articles. For phrase
      parsing and information extraction, we present the novel use of multiple
      rule-based grammars that are tailored for interpreting specific document domains 
      such as textual paragraphs, captions, and tables. We also describe document-level
      processing to resolve data interdependencies and show that this is particularly
      necessary for the autogeneration of chemical databases since captions and tables 
      commonly contain chemical identifiers and references that are defined elsewhere
      in the text. The performance of the toolkit to correctly extract various types of
      data was evaluated, affording an F-score of 93.4%, 86.8%, and 91.5% for
      extracting chemical identifiers, spectroscopic attributes, and chemical property 
      attributes, respectively; set against the CHEMDNER chemical name extraction
      challenge, ChemDataExtractor yields a competitive F-score of 87.8%. All tools
      have been released under the MIT license and are available to download from
      http://www.chemdataextractor.org .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records are being increasingly used by nurses with 
      up to 80% of the health data recorded as free text. However, only a few studies
      have developed nursing-relevant tools that help busy clinicians to identify
      information they need at the point of care. OBJECTIVE: This study developed and
      validated one of the first automated natural language processing applications to 
      extract wound information (wound type, pressure ulcer stage, wound size, anatomic
      location, and wound treatment) from free text clinical notes. METHODS AND DESIGN:
      First, two human annotators manually reviewed a purposeful training sample
      (n=360) and random test sample (n=1100) of clinical notes (including 50%
      discharge summaries and 50% outpatient notes), identified wound cases, and
      created a gold standard dataset. We then trained and tested our natural language 
      processing system (known as MTERMS) to process the wound information. Finally, we
      assessed our automated approach by comparing system-generated findings against
      the gold standard. We also compared the prevalence of wound cases identified from
      free-text data with coded diagnoses in the structured data. RESULTS: The testing 
      dataset included 101 notes (9.2%) with wound information. The overall system
      performance was good (F-measure is a compiled measure of system's
      accuracy=92.7%), with best results for wound treatment (F-measure=95.7%) and
      poorest results for wound size (F-measure=81.9%). Only 46.5% of wound notes had a
      structured code for a wound diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The natural language
      processing system achieved good performance on a subset of randomly selected
      discharge summaries and outpatient notes. In more than half of the wound notes,
      there were no coded wound diagnoses, which highlight the significance of using
      natural language processing to enrich clinical decision making. Our future steps 
      will include expansion of the application's information coverage to other
      relevant wound factors and validation of the model with external data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of incidentally detected lung nodules is rapidly
      rising, but little is known about their management or associated patient
      outcomes. One barrier to studying lung nodule care is the inability to
      efficiently and reliably identify the cohort of interest (i.e. cases).
      Investigators at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) recently developed 
      an automated method to identify individuals with an incidentally discovered lung 
      nodule, but the feasibility of implementing this method across other health
      systems is unknown. METHODS: A random sample of Group Health (GH) members who had
      a computed tomography in 2012 underwent chart review to determine if a lung
      nodule was documented in the radiology report. A previously developed natural
      language processing (NLP) algorithm was implemented at our site using only
      knowledge of the key words, qualifiers, excluding terms, and the logic linking
      these parameters. RESULTS: Among 499 subjects, 156 (31%, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 27-36%) had an incidentally detected lung nodule. NLP identified 189 (38%,
      95% CI 33-42%) individuals with a nodule. The accuracy of NLP at GH was similar
      to its accuracy at KPSC: sensitivity 90% (95% CI 85-95%) and specificity 86% (95%
      CI 82-89%) versus sensitivity 96% (95% CI 88-100%) and specificity 86% (95% CI
      75-94%). CONCLUSION: Automated methods designed to identify individuals with an
      incidentally detected lung nodule can feasibly and independently be implemented
      across health systems. Use of these methods will likely facilitate the efficient 
      conduct of multi-site studies evaluating practice patterns and associated
      outcomes.

TI  - Natural Language Processing Based Instrument for Classification of Free Text
      Medical Records.
PG  - 8313454
AB  - According to the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia a new
      health management system has to be introduced in the nearest future. In this
      context arises the problem of structuring and classifying documents containing
      all the history of medical services provided. The present work introduces the
      instrument for classification of medical records based on the Georgian language. 
      It is the first attempt of such classification of the Georgian language based
      medical records. On the whole 24.855 examination records have been studied. The
      documents were classified into three main groups (ultrasonography, endoscopy, and
      X-ray) and 13 subgroups using two well-known methods: Support Vector Machine
      (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The results obtained demonstrated that both
      machine learning methods performed successfully, with a little supremacy of SVM. 
      In the process of classification a "shrink" method, based on features selection, 
      was introduced and applied. At the first stage of classification the results of
      the "shrink" case were better; however, on the second stage of classification
      into subclasses 23% of all documents could not be linked to only one definite
      individual subclass (liver or binary system) due to common features
      characterizing these subclasses. The overall results of the study were
      successful.

TI  - Automatic classification of registered clinical trials towards the Global Burden 
      of Diseases taxonomy of diseases and injuries.
PG  - 392
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trial registries may allow for producing a global mapping of
      health research. However, health conditions are not described with standardized
      taxonomies in registries. Previous work analyzed clinical trial registries to
      improve the retrieval of relevant clinical trials for patients. However, no
      previous work has classified clinical trials across diseases using a standardized
      taxonomy allowing a comparison between global health research and global burden
      across diseases. We developed a knowledge-based classifier of health conditions
      studied in registered clinical trials towards categories of diseases and injuries
      from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2010 study. The classifier relies on the
      UMLS(R) knowledge source (Unified Medical Language System(R)) and on heuristic
      algorithms for parsing data. It maps trial records to a 28-class grouping of the 
      GBD categories by automatically extracting UMLS concepts from text fields and by 
      projecting concepts between medical terminologies. The classifier allows deriving
      pathways between the clinical trial record and candidate GBD categories using
      natural language processing and links between knowledge sources, and selects the 
      relevant GBD classification based on rules of prioritization across the pathways 
      found. We compared automatic and manual classifications for an external test set 
      of 2,763 trials. We automatically classified 109,603 interventional trials
      registered before February 2014 at WHO ICTRP. RESULTS: In the external test set, 
      the classifier identified the exact GBD categories for 78 % of the trials. It had
      very good performance for most of the 28 categories, especially "Neoplasms"
      (sensitivity 97.4 %, specificity 97.5 %). The sensitivity was moderate for trials
      not relevant to any GBD category (53 %) and low for trials of injuries (16 %).
      For the 109,603 trials registered at WHO ICTRP, the classifier did not assign any
      GBD category to 20.5 % of trials while the most common GBD categories were
      "Neoplasms" (22.8 %) and "Diabetes" (8.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and
      validated a knowledge-based classifier allowing for automatically identifying the
      diseases studied in registered trials by using the taxonomy from the GBD 2010
      study. This tool is freely available to the research community and can be used
      for large-scale public health studies.

TI  - solveME: fast and reliable solution of nonlinear ME models.
PG  - 391
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME) 
      significantly expand the scope and predictive capabilities of constraint-based
      modeling. ME models present considerable computational challenges: they are much 
      (>30 times) larger than corresponding metabolic reconstructions (M models), are
      multiscale, and growth maximization is a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem,
      mainly due to macromolecule dilution constraints. RESULTS: Here, we address these
      computational challenges. We develop a fast and numerically reliable solution
      method for growth maximization in ME models using a quad-precision NLP solver
      (Quad MINOS). Our method was up to 45 % faster than binary search for six
      significant digits in growth rate. We also develop a fast, quad-precision flux
      variability analysis that is accelerated (up to 60x speedup) via solver
      warm-starts. Finally, we employ the tools developed to investigate growth-coupled
      succinate overproduction, accounting for proteome constraints. CONCLUSIONS: Just 
      as genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have become an invaluable tool for
      computational and systems biologists, we anticipate that these fast and
      numerically reliable ME solution methods will accelerate the wide-spread adoption
      of ME models for researchers in these fields.

TI  - Characterizing the (Perceived) Newsworthiness of Health Science Articles: A
      Data-Driven Approach.
PG  - e27
LID - 10.2196/medinform.5353 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health science findings are primarily disseminated through manuscript
      publications. Information subsidies are used to communicate newsworthy findings
      to journalists in an effort to earn mass media coverage and further disseminate
      health science research to mass audiences. Journal editors and news journalists
      then select which news stories receive coverage and thus public attention.
      OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify attributes of published health science
      articles that correlate with (1) journal editor issuance of press releases and
      (2) mainstream media coverage. METHODS: We constructed four novel datasets to
      identify factors that correlate with press release issuance and media coverage.
      These corpora include thousands of published articles, subsets of which received 
      press release or mainstream media coverage. We used statistical machine learning 
      methods to identify correlations between words in the science abstracts and press
      release issuance and media coverage. Further, we used a topic modeling-based
      machine learning approach to uncover latent topics predictive of the perceived
      newsworthiness of science articles. RESULTS: Both press release issuance for, and
      media coverage of, health science articles are predictable from corresponding
      journal article content. For the former task, we achieved average areas under the
      curve (AUCs) of 0.666 (SD 0.019) and 0.882 (SD 0.018) on two separate datasets,
      comprising 3024 and 10,760 articles, respectively. For the latter task, models
      realized mean AUCs of 0.591 (SD 0.044) and 0.783 (SD 0.022) on two datasets-in
      this case containing 422 and 28,910 pairs, respectively. We reported
      most-predictive words and topics for press release or news coverage. CONCLUSIONS:
      We have presented a novel data-driven characterization of content that renders
      health science "newsworthy." The analysis provides new insights into the news
      coverage selection process. For example, it appears epidemiological papers
      concerning common behaviors (eg, alcohol consumption) tend to receive media
      attention.

TI  - An overview of topic modeling and its current applications in bioinformatics.
PG  - 1608
LID - 10.1186/s40064-016-3252-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid accumulation of biological datasets, machine learning 
      methods designed to automate data analysis are urgently needed. In recent years, 
      so-called topic models that originated from the field of natural language
      processing have been receiving much attention in bioinformatics because of their 
      interpretability. Our aim was to review the application and development of topic 
      models for bioinformatics. DESCRIPTION: This paper starts with the description of
      a topic model, with a focus on the understanding of topic modeling. A general
      outline is provided on how to build an application in a topic model and how to
      develop a topic model. Meanwhile, the literature on application of topic models
      to biological data was searched and analyzed in depth. According to the types of 
      models and the analogy between the concept of document-topic-word and a
      biological object (as well as the tasks of a topic model), we categorized the
      related studies and provided an outlook on the use of topic models for the
      development of bioinformatics applications. CONCLUSION: Topic modeling is a
      useful method (in contrast to the traditional means of data reduction in
      bioinformatics) and enhances researchers' ability to interpret biological
      information. Nevertheless, due to the lack of topic models optimized for specific
      biological data, the studies on topic modeling in biological data still have a
      long and challenging road ahead. We believe that topic models are a promising
      method for various applications in bioinformatics research.

TI  - A corpus for plant-chemical relationships in the biomedical domain.
PG  - 386
LID - 10.1186/s12859-016-1249-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plants are natural products that humans consume in various ways
      including food and medicine. They have a long empirical history of treating
      diseases with relatively few side effects. Based on these strengths, many studies
      have been performed to verify the effectiveness of plants in treating diseases.
      It is crucial to understand the chemicals contained in plants because these
      chemicals can regulate activities of proteins that are key factors in causing
      diseases. With the accumulation of a large volume of biomedical literature in
      various databases such as PubMed, it is possible to automatically extract
      relationships between plants and chemicals in a large-scale way if we apply a
      text mining approach. A cornerstone of achieving this task is a corpus of
      relationships between plants and chemicals. RESULTS: In this study, we first
      constructed a corpus for plant and chemical entities and for the relationships
      between them. The corpus contains 267 plant entities, 475 chemical entities, and 
      1,007 plant-chemical relationships (550 and 457 positive and negative
      relationships, respectively), which are drawn from 377 sentences in 245 PubMed
      abstracts. Inter-annotator agreement scores for the corpus among three annotators
      were measured. The simple percent agreement scores for entities and trigger words
      for the relationships were 99.6 and 94.8 %, respectively, and the overall kappa
      score for the classification of positive and negative relationships was 79.8 %.
      We also developed a rule-based model to automatically extract such plant-chemical
      relationships. When we evaluated the rule-based model using the corpus and
      randomly selected biomedical articles, overall F-scores of 68.0 and 61.8 % were
      achieved, respectively. CONCLUSION: We expect that the corpus for plant-chemical 
      relationships will be a useful resource for enhancing plant research. The corpus 
      is available at http://combio.gist.ac.kr/plantchemicalcorpus .

TI  - Use of emergency department electronic medical records for automated
      epidemiological surveillance of suicide attempts: a French pilot study.
LID - 10.1002/mpr.1522 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether an expert system based on
      automated processing of electronic health records (EHRs) could provide a more
      accurate estimate of the annual rate of emergency department (ED) visits for
      suicide attempts in France, as compared to the current national surveillance
      system based on manual coding by emergency practitioners. A feasibility study was
      conducted at Lyon University Hospital, using data for all ED patient visits in
      2012. After automatic data extraction and pre-processing, including automatic
      coding of medical free-text through use of the Unified Medical Language System,
      seven different machine-learning methods were used to classify the reasons for ED
      visits into "suicide attempts" versus "other reasons". The performance of these
      different methods was compared by using the F-measure. In a test sample of 444
      patients admitted to the ED in 2012 (98 suicide attempts, 48 cases of suicidal
      ideation, and 292 controls with no recorded non-fatal suicidal behaviour), the
      F-measure for automatic detection of suicide attempts ranged from 70.4% to 95.3%.
      The random forest and naive Bayes methods performed best. This study demonstrates
      that machine-learning methods can improve the quality of epidemiological
      indicators as compared to current national surveillance of suicide attempts.

TI  - The use of natural language processing on narrative medication schedules to
      compute average weekly dose.
PG  - 1414-1424
LID - 10.1002/pds.4086 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Medications with non-standard dosing and unstandardized units of
      measurement make the estimation of prescribed dose difficult from pharmacy
      dispensing data. A natural language processing tool named the SIG extractor was
      developed to identify and extract elements from narrative medication instructions
      to compute average weekly doses (AWDs) for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.
      The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the SIG extractor.
      METHOD: This agreement study utilized Veterans Health Affairs pharmacy data from 
      2008 to 2012. The SIG extractor was designed to extract key elements from
      narrative medication schedules (SIGs) for 17 select medications to calculate AWD,
      and these medications were categorized by generic name and route of
      administration. The SIG extractor was evaluated against an annotator-derived
      reference standard for accuracy, which is the fraction of AWDs accurately
      computed. RESULTS: The overall accuracy was 89% [95% confidence interval (CI)
      88%, 90%]. The accuracy was >/=85% for all medications and route combinations,
      except for cyclophosphamide (oral) and cyclosporine (oral), which were 79% (95%CI
      72%, 85%) and 66% (95%CI 58%, 73%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The SIG extractor 
      performed well on the majority of medications, indicating that AWD calculated by 
      the SIG extractor can be used to improve estimation of AWD when dispensed
      quantity or days' supply is questionable or improbable. The working model for
      annotating SIGs and the SIG extractor are generalized and can easily be applied
      to other medications. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Studying Associations Between Heart Failure Self-Management and
      Rehospitalizations Using Natural Language Processing.
LID - 0193945916668493 [pii]
AB  - This study developed an innovative natural language processing algorithm to
      automatically identify heart failure (HF) patients with ineffective
      self-management status (in the domains of diet, physical activity, medication
      adherence, and adherence to clinician appointments) from narrative discharge
      summary notes. We also analyzed the association between self-management status
      and preventable 30-day hospital readmissions. Our natural language system
      achieved relatively high accuracy (F-measure = 86.3%; precision = 95%; recall =
      79.2%) on a testing sample of 300 notes annotated by two human reviewers. In a
      sample of 8,901 HF patients admitted to our healthcare system, 14.4% (n = 1,282) 
      had documentation of ineffective HF self-management. Adjusted regression analyses
      indicated that presence of any skill-related self-management deficit (odds ratio 
      [OR] = 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.1, 1.6]) and non-specific
      ineffective self-management (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = [1.2, 2]) was significantly
      associated with readmissions. We have demonstrated the feasibility of identifying
      ineffective HF self-management from electronic discharge summaries with natural
      language processing.

AB  - Importance: Suicide represents the 10th leading cause of death across age groups 
      in the United States (12.6 cases per 100000) and remains challenging to predict. 
      While many individuals who die by suicide are seen by physicians before their
      attempt, they may not seek psychiatric care. Objective: To determine the extent
      to which incorporating natural language processing of narrative discharge notes
      improves stratification of risk for death by suicide after medical or surgical
      hospital discharge. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective
      health care use study, clinical data were analyzed from individuals with
      discharges from 2 large academic medical centers between January 1, 2005, and
      December 31, 2013. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was suicide as
      a reported cause of death based on Massachusetts Department of Public Health
      records. Regression models for prediction of death by suicide or accidental death
      were compared relying solely on coded clinical data and those using natural
      language processing of hospital discharge notes. Results: There were 845417
      hospital discharges represented in the cohort, including 458053 unique
      individuals. Overall, all-cause mortality was 18% during 9 years, and the median 
      follow-up was 5.2 years. The cohort included 235 (0.1%) who died by suicide
      during 2.4 million patient-years of follow-up. Positive valence reflected in
      narrative notes was associated with a 30% reduction in risk for suicide in models
      adjusted for coded sociodemographic and clinical features (hazard ratio, 0.70;
      95% CI, 0.58-0.85; P < .001) and improved model fit (chi22 = 14.843, P < .001 by 
      log-likelihood test). The C statistic was 0.741 (95% CI, 0.738-0.744) for models 
      of suicide with or without inclusion of accidental death. Conclusions and
      Relevance: Multiple clinical features available at hospital discharge identified 
      a cohort of individuals at substantially increased risk for suicide. Greater
      positive valence expressed in narrative discharge summaries was associated with
      substantially diminished risk. Automated tools to aid clinicians in evaluating
      these risks may assist in identifying high-risk individuals.

AB  - Loss of light perception (LP) after open globe injury (OGI) does not necessarily 
      mean the patient will have permanent complete visual loss. Findings that seem to 
      be associated reliably with permanent profound vision loss after OGI include
      optic nerve avulsion, optic nerve transection, and profound loss of intraocular
      contents, which can be identified with CT/MRI imaging albeit with varying degrees
      of confidence. Eyes with NLP after OGI that undergo successful primary repair
      with intact optic nerves may be considered for additional surgery, particularly
      if there is: (1) recovery of LP on the first day after primary repair; (2)
      treatable pathology underlying NLP status (e.g., extensive choroidal hemorrhage, 
      dense vitreous and subretinal hemorrhage); (3) NLP in the fellow eye. We counsel 
      patients that the chance of recovering ambulatory vision under these
      circumstances is very low (~5%).

AB  - We report the coexistence of high-order harmonic soliton molecules and
      rectangular noise-like pulses (NLP) in a figure-eight fiber laser mode-locked by 
      a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror. The harmonic soliton molecule has a
      repetition rate of 936.6 MHz, corresponding to the 466th harmonics of the
      fundamental cavity repetition rate, with soliton separation of 16.5 ps.
      Meanwhile, the rectangular NLP operates at the fundamental repetition rate. In
      addition, these two types of pulses could be generated independently by
      manipulating the polarization controllers. The experimental results demonstrate
      an interesting operation regime of the fiber laser and contribute to enriching
      the dynamics of mode-locked pulses in fiber lasers.

AB  - We report on the generation of noise-like pulse (NLP) trains in a Tm-doped fiber 
      laser mode-locked by multilayer graphene saturable absorber. The spectral
      bandwidth obtained directly from the oscillator exceeds 60 nm, centered at 1950
      nm, with 23.5 MHz repetition rate. The pulses were also amplified in a fully
      fiberized amplifier based on a double-cladding Tm-doped fiber. The system was
      capable of delivering 1.21 W of average power, which corresponds to 51.5 nJ
      energy stored in the noise-like bundle. We believe that the presented source
      might serve as a pump for supercontinuum generation in highly nonlinear fibers.

TI  - An Infinite Mixture Model for Coreference Resolution in Clinical Notes.
PG  - 428-37
AB  - It is widely acknowledged that natural language processing is indispensable to
      process electronic health records (EHRs). However, poor performance in relation
      detection tasks, such as coreference (linguistic expressions pertaining to the
      same entity/event) may affect the quality of EHR processing. Hence, there is a
      critical need to advance the research for relation detection from EHRs. Most of
      the clinical coreference resolution systems are based on either supervised
      machine learning or rule-based methods. The need for manually annotated corpus
      hampers the use of such system in large scale. In this paper, we present an
      infinite mixture model method using definite sampling to resolve coreferent
      relations among mentions in clinical notes. A similarity measure function is
      proposed to determine the coreferent relations. Our system achieved a 0.847
      F-measure for i2b2 2011 coreference corpus. This promising results and the
      unsupervised nature make it possible to apply the system in big-data clinical
      setting.

PG  - 84-93
AB  - The impact of ethnobotanical data from surveys of traditional medicinal uses
      ofplants can be enhanced through the validation of biomedical knowledge that may 
      be embedded in literature. This study aimed to explore the use of informatics
      approaches, including natural language processing and terminology resources, for 
      extracting and comparing ethnobotanical leads from biomedical literature indexed 
      in MEDLINE. Using ethnobotanical data for plant species described in Primary
      Health Care Manuals of the Micronesian islands of Palau and Pohnpei, the results 
      of this study were done relative to disease concepts from the "Mental, Behavioral
      And Neurodevelopmental Disorders " ICD-9-CM category. The results from this
      feasibility study suggest that informatics methods can be used to extract and
      prioritize relevant ethnobotanical information from biomedical knowledge
      literature.

AB  - Purpose. To investigate the prognostic factors for visual outcome in traumatic
      cataract patients. Methods. The demographic features of traumatic cataract
      patients in Central China were studied. The factors that might influence the
      visual outcome were analyzed. The sensitivity and specificity of OTS (ocular
      trauma score) in predicting VA were calculated. Results. The study enrolled 480
      cases. 65.5% of patients achieved VA at >20/60. The factors associated with the
      final VA were initial VA, injury type, wound location, the way of cataract
      removal, and IOL implantation. The sensitivities of OTS in predicting the VA at
      NLP (nonlight perception), LP/HM (light perception/hand motion), and >/=20/40
      were 100%. The specificity of OTS to predict the final VA at 1/200-19/200 and
      20/200-20/50 was 100%. Conclusion. The prognostic factors were initial VA, injury
      type, wound location, cataract removal procedure, and the way of IOL
      implantation. The OTS has good sensitivity and specificity in predicting visual
      outcome in traumatic cataract patients in long follow-up.

TI  - Deriving Shape-Based Features for C. elegans Locomotion Using Dimensionality
      Reduction Methods.
PG  - 159
LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2016.00159 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput analysis of animal behavior is increasingly common following the 
      advances of recording technology, leading to large high-dimensional data sets.
      This dimensionality can sometimes be reduced while still retaining relevant
      information. In the case of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, more than
      90% of the shape variance can be captured using just four principal components.
      However, it remains unclear if other methods can achieve a more compact
      representation or contribute further biological insight to worm locomotion. Here 
      we take a data-driven approach to worm shape analysis using independent component
      analysis (ICA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a cosine series, and
      jPCA (a dynamic variant of principal component analysis [PCA]) and confirm that
      the dimensionality of worm shape space is close to four. Projecting worm shapes
      onto the bases derived using each method gives interpretable features ranging
      from head movements to tail oscillation. We use these as a comparison method to
      find differences between the wild type N2 worms and various mutants. For example,
      we find that the neuropeptide mutant nlp-1(ok1469) has an exaggerated head
      movement suggesting a mode of action for the previously described increased
      turning rate. The different bases provide complementary views of worm behavior
      and we expect that closer examination of the time series of projected amplitudes 
      will lead to new results in the future.

TI  - Automated detection of discourse segment and experimental types from the text of 
      cancer pathway results sections.
LID - 10.1093/database/baw122 [doi]
LID - baw122 [pii]
AB  - Automated machine-reading biocuration systems typically use sentence-by-sentence 
      information extraction to construct meaning representations for use by curators. 
      This does not directly reflect the typical discourse structure used by scientists
      to construct an argument from the experimental data available within a article,
      and is therefore less likely to correspond to representations typically used in
      biomedical informatics systems (let alone to the mental models that scientists
      have). In this study, we develop Natural Language Processing methods to locate,
      extract, and classify the individual passages of text from articles' Results
      sections that refer to experimental data. In our domain of interest (molecular
      biology studies of cancer signal transduction pathways), individual articles may 
      contain as many as 30 small-scale individual experiments describing a variety of 
      findings, upon which authors base their overall research conclusions. Our system 
      automatically classifies discourse segments in these texts into seven categories 
      (fact, hypothesis, problem, goal, method, result, implication) with an F-score of
      0.68. These segments describe the essential building blocks of scientific
      discourse to (i) provide context for each experiment, (ii) report experimental
      details and (iii) explain the data's meaning in context. We evaluate our system
      on text passages from articles that were curated in molecular biology databases
      (the Pathway Logic Datum repository, the Molecular Interaction MINT and INTACT
      databases) linking individual experiments in articles to the type of assay used
      (coprecipitation, phosphorylation, translocation etc.). We use supervised machine
      learning techniques on text passages containing unambiguous references to
      experiments to obtain baseline F1 scores of 0.59 for MINT, 0.71 for INTACT and
      0.63 for Pathway Logic. Although preliminary, these results support the notion
      that targeting information extraction methods to experimental results could
      provide accurate, automated methods for biocuration. We also suggest the need for
      finer-grained curation of experimental methods used when constructing molecular
      biology databases.

TI  - Lower expressed miR-198 and its potential targets in hepatocellular carcinoma: a 
      clinicopathological and in silico study.
PG  - 5163-80
LID - 10.2147/OTT.S108828 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinicopathological value and potential roles of
      microRNA-198 (miR-198) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Ninety-five
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded HCC and the para-cancerous liver tissues were
      gathered. Real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
      was applied to determine the miR-198 expression. The association between the
      miR-198 expression and clinicopathological features was examined. Meanwhile,
      potential target messenger RNAs of miR-198 in HCC were obtained from 14 miRNA
      prediction databases and natural language processing method, in which we pooled
      the genes related to the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC and classified them
      by their frequency. The selected target genes were finally analyzed in the Gene
      Ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway. RESULTS:
      miR-198 expression was significantly lower in HCC than that in adjacent
      noncancerous liver tissues (1.30+/-0.72 vs 2.01+/-0.58, P<0.001). Low miR-198
      expression was also correlated to hepatitis C virus infection (r=-0.48, P<0.001),
      tumor capsular infiltration (r=-0.43, P<0.001), metastasis (r=-0.26, P<0.010),
      number of tumor nodes (r=-0.25, P=0.013), vaso-invasion (r=-0.24, P=0.017), and
      clinical tumor node metastasis stage (r=-0.23, P=0.024). Altogether, 1,048 genes 
      were achieved by the concurrent prediction from at least four databases and
      natural language processing indicated 1,800 genes for HCC. Further, 127
      overlapping targets were further proceeded with for pathway analysis. The most
      enriched Gene Ontology terms in the potential target messenger RNAs of miR-198
      were cell motion, cell migration, cell motility, and regulation of cell
      proliferation in biological process; organelle lumen, membrane-enclosed lumen,
      and nuclear lumen in cellular component; and enzyme binding, protein
      domain-specific binding, and protein kinase activity in molecular function. Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that these target genes were
      obviously involved in focal adhesion and pathways in cancer. CONCLUSION: Lower
      expression of miR-198 was related to several clinicopathological parameters in
      HCC patients. miR-198 might play a regulatory role through its target genes in
      the development of HCC.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Drug Adverse Effects from Product Characteristics (SPCs):
      A Text Versus Table Comparison.
PG  - 339-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Potential adverse effects (AEs) of drugs are described in their
      summary of product characteristics (SPCs), a textual document. Automatic
      extraction of AEs from SPCs is useful for detecting AEs and for building drug
      databases. However, this task is difficult because each AE is associated with a
      frequency that must be extracted and the presentation of AEs in SPCs is
      heterogeneous, consisting of plain text and tables in many different formats.
      METHODS: We propose a taxonomy for the presentation of AEs in SPCs. We set up
      natural language processing (NLP) and table parsing methods for extracting AEs
      from texts and tables of any format, and evaluate them on 10 SPCs. RESULTS:
      Automatic extraction performed better on tables than on texts. CONCLUSION: Tables
      should be recommended for the presentation of the AEs section of the SPCs.

TI  - Correlating mammographic and pathologic findings in clinical decision support
      using natural language processing and data mining methods.
PG  - 114-121
LID - 10.1002/cncr.30245 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A key challenge to mining electronic health records for mammography
      research is the preponderance of unstructured narrative text, which strikingly
      limits usable output. The imaging characteristics of breast cancer subtypes have 
      been described previously, but without standardization of parameters for data
      mining. METHODS: The authors searched the enterprise-wide data warehouse at the
      Houston Methodist Hospital, the Methodist Environment for Translational
      Enhancement and Outcomes Research (METEOR), for patients with Breast Imaging
      Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 5 mammogram readings performed
      between January 2006 and May 2015 and an available pathology report. The authors 
      developed natural language processing (NLP) software algorithms to automatically 
      extract mammographic and pathologic findings from free text mammogram and
      pathology reports. The correlation between mammographic imaging features and
      breast cancer subtype was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and the
      Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The NLP algorithm was able to obtain key
      characteristics for 543 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Patients with
      estrogen receptor-positive tumors were more likely to have spiculated margins (P 
      = .0008), and those with tumors that overexpressed human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor 2 (HER2) were more likely to have heterogeneous and pleomorphic
      calcifications (P = .0078 and P = .0002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mammographic
      imaging characteristics, obtained from an automated text search and the
      extraction of mammogram reports using NLP techniques, correlated with pathologic 
      breast cancer subtype. The results of the current study validate previously
      reported trends assessed by manual data collection. Furthermore, NLP provides an 
      automated means with which to scale up data extraction and analysis for clinical 
      decision support. Cancer 2017;114-121. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

TI  - Tumor information extraction in radiology reports for hepatocellular carcinoma
      patients.
PG  - 455-64
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly disease affecting the liver for which 
      there are many available therapies. Targeting treatments towards specific patient
      groups necessitates defining patients by stage of disease. Criteria for such
      stagings include information on tumor number, size, and anatomic location,
      typically only found in narrative clinical text in the electronic medical record 
      (EMR). Natural language processing (NLP) offers an automatic and scale-able means
      to extract this information, which can further evidence-based research. In this
      paper, we created a corpus of 101 radiology reports annotated for tumor
      information. Afterwards we applied machine learning algorithms to extract tumor
      information. Our inter-annotator partial match agreement scored at 0.93 and 0.90 
      F1 for entities and relations, respectively. Based on the annotated corpus, our
      sequential labeling entity extraction achieved 0.87 F1 partial match, and our
      maximum entropy classification relation extraction achieved scores 0.89 and 0. 74
      F1 with gold and system entities, respectively.

TI  - Towards Evidence-based Precision Medicine: Extracting Population Information from
      Biomedical Text using Binary Classifiers and Syntactic Patterns.
PG  - 203-12
AB  - Precision Medicine is an emerging approach for prevention and treatment of
      disease that considers individual variability in genes, environment, and
      lifestyle for each person. The dissemination of individualized evidence by
      automatically identifying population information in literature is a key for
      evidence-based precision medicine at the point-of-care. We propose a hybrid
      approach using natural language processing techniques to automatically extract
      the population information from biomedical literature. Our approach first
      implements a binary classifier to classify sentences with or without population
      information. A rule-based system based on syntactic-tree regular expressions is
      then applied to sentences containing population information to extract the
      population named entities. The proposed two-stage approach achieved an F-score of
      0.81 using a MaxEnt classifier and the rule- based system, and an F-score of 0.87
      using a Nai've-Bayes classifier and the rule-based system, and performed
      relatively well compared to many existing systems. The system and evaluation
      dataset is being released as open source.

TI  - NLP-PIER: A Scalable Natural Language Processing, Indexing, and Searching
      Architecture for Clinical Notes.
PG  - 150-9
AB  - Many design considerations must be addressed in order to provide researchers with
      full text and semantic search of unstructured healthcare data such as clinical
      notes and reports. Institutions looking at providing this functionality must also
      address the big data aspects of their unstructured corpora. Because these systems
      are complex and demand a non-trivial investment, there is an incentive to make
      the system capable of servicing future needs as well, further complicating the
      design. We present architectural best practices as lessons learned in the design 
      and implementation NLP-PIER (Patient Information Extraction for Research), a
      scalable, extensible, and secure system for processing, indexing, and searching
      clinical notes at the University of Minnesota.

TI  - A Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluation of Sentence Boundary Detection for the 
      Clinical Domain.
PG  - 88-97
AB  - Sentence boundary detection (SBD) is a critical preprocessing task for many
      natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, there has been little
      work on evaluating how well existing methods for SBD perform in the clinical
      domain. We evaluate five popular off-the-shelf NLP toolkits on the task of SBD in
      various kinds of text using a diverse set of corpora, including the GENIA corpus 
      of biomedical abstracts, a corpus of clinical notes used in the 2010 i2b2 shared 
      task, and two general-domain corpora (the British National Corpus and
      Switchboard). We find that, with the exception of the cTAKES system, the toolkits
      we evaluate perform noticeably worse on clinical text than on general-domain
      text. We identify and discuss major classes of errors, and suggest directions for
      future work to improve SBD methods in the clinical domain. We also make the code 
      used for SBD evaluation in this paper available for download at
      http://github.com/drgriffis/SBD-Evaluation.

TI  - Learning Low-Dimensional Representations of Medical Concepts.
PG  - 41-50
AB  - We show how to learn low-dimensional representations (embeddings) of a wide range
      of concepts in medicine, including diseases (e.g., ICD9 codes), medications,
      procedures, and laboratory tests. We expect that these embeddings will be useful 
      across medical informatics for tasks such as cohort selection and patient
      summarization. These embeddings are learned using a technique called neural
      language modeling from the natural language processing community. However, rather
      than learning the embeddings solely from text, we show how to learn the
      embeddings from claims data, which is widely available both to providers and to
      payers. We also show that with a simple algorithmic adjustment, it is possible to
      learn medical concept embeddings in a privacy preserving manner from
      co-occurrence counts derived from clinical narratives. Finally, we establish a
      methodological framework, arising from standard medical ontologies such as UMLS, 
      NDF-RT, and CCS, to further investigate the embeddings and precisely characterize
      their quantitative properties.

      requests expressed in natural language.
PG  - 1324
LID - 10.1186/s40064-016-3012-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of a CRF-based
      learning method for identifying necessary Web of Things (WoT) application
      components that would satisfy the users' requests issued in natural language. For
      instance, a user request such as "archive all sports breaking news" can be
      satisfied by composing a WoT application that consists of ESPN breaking news
      service and Dropbox as a storage service. FINDINGS: We built an engine that can
      identify the necessary application components by recognizing a main act (MA) or
      named entities (NEs) from a given request. We trained this engine with the
      descriptions of WoT applications (called recipes) that were collected from IFTTT 
      WoT platform. IFTTT hosts over 300 WoT entities that offer thousands of functions
      referred to as triggers and actions. There are more than 270,000
      publicly-available recipes composed with those functions by real users.
      Therefore, the set of these recipes is well-qualified for the training of our MA 
      and NE recognition engine. CONLUSIONS: We share our unique experience of
      generating the training and test set from these recipe descriptions and assess
      the performance of the CRF-based language method. Based on the performance
      evaluation, we introduce further research directions.

TI  - Multilingual Sentiment Analysis: State of the Art and Independent Comparison of
      Techniques.
PG  - 757-771
AB  - With the advent of Internet, people actively express their opinions about
      products, services, events, political parties, etc., in social media, blogs, and 
      website comments. The amount of research work on sentiment analysis is growing
      explosively. However, the majority of research efforts are devoted to
      English-language data, while a great share of information is available in other
      languages. We present a state-of-the-art review on multilingual sentiment
      analysis. More importantly, we compare our own implementation of existing
      approaches on common data. Precision observed in our experiments is typically
      lower than the one reported by the original authors, which we attribute to the
      lack of detail in the original presentation of those approaches. Thus, we compare
      the existing works by what they really offer to the reader, including whether
      they allow for accurate implementation and for reliable reproduction of the
      reported results.

TI  - C. elegans Stress-Induced Sleep Emerges from the Collective Action of Multiple
      Neuropeptides.

LID - S0960-9822(16)30841-7 [pii]
AB  - The genetic basis of sleep regulation remains poorly understood. In C. elegans,
      cellular stress induces sleep through epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent
      activation of the EGF receptor in the ALA neuron. The downstream mechanism by
      which this neuron promotes sleep is unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing of ALA
      reveals that the most highly expressed, ALA-enriched genes encode neuropeptides. 
      Here we have systematically investigated the four most highly enriched
      neuropeptides: flp-7, nlp-8, flp-24, and flp-13. When individually removed by
      null mutation, these peptides had little or no effect on stress-induced sleep.
      However, stress-induced sleep was abolished in nlp-8; flp-24; flp-13
      triple-mutant animals, indicating that these neuropeptides work collectively in
      controlling stress-induced sleep. We tested the effect of overexpression of these
      neuropeptide genes on five behaviors modulated during sleep-pharyngeal pumping,
      defecation, locomotion, head movement, and avoidance response to an aversive
      stimulus-and we found that, if individually overexpressed, each of three
      neuropeptides (nlp-8, flp-24, or flp-13) induced a different suite of
      sleep-associated behaviors. These overexpression results raise the possibility
      that individual components of sleep might be specified by individual
      neuropeptides or combinations of neuropeptides.

AB  - The American marten (Martes americana) was reintroduced to both the Upper (UP)
      and northern Lower Peninsula (NLP) of Michigan during the 20th century. This is
      the first report of endoparasites of American marten from the NLP. Faeces from
      live-trapped American marten were examined for the presence of parasitic ova, and
      blood samples were obtained for haematocrit evaluation. The most prevalent
      parasites were Capillaria and Alaria species. Helminth parasites reported in
      American marten for the first time include Eucoleus boehmi, hookworm, and
      Hymenolepis and Strongyloides species. This is the first report of shedding of
      Sarcocystis species sporocysts in an American marten and identification of 2
      coccidian parasites, Cystoisospora and Eimeria species. The pathologic and
      zoonotic potential of each parasite species is discussed, and previous reports of
      endoparasites of the American marten in North America are reviewed.

TI  - Corpus domain effects on distributional semantic modeling of medical terms.
PG  - 3635-3644
AB  - MOTIVATION: Automatically quantifying semantic similarity and relatedness between
      clinical terms is an important aspect of text mining from electronic health
      records, which are increasingly recognized as valuable sources of phenotypic
      information for clinical genomics and bioinformatics research. A key obstacle to 
      development of semantic relatedness measures is the limited availability of large
      quantities of clinical text to researchers and developers outside of major
      medical centers. Text from general English and biomedical literature are freely
      available; however, their validity as a substitute for clinical domain to
      represent semantics of clinical terms remains to be demonstrated. RESULTS: We
      constructed neural network representations of clinical terms found in a publicly 
      available benchmark dataset manually labeled for semantic similarity and
      relatedness. Similarity and relatedness measures computed from text corpora in
      three domains (Clinical Notes, PubMed Central articles and Wikipedia) were
      compared using the benchmark as reference. We found that measures computed from
      full text of biomedical articles in PubMed Central repository (rho = 0.62 for
      similarity and 0.58 for relatedness) are on par with measures computed from
      clinical reports (rho = 0.60 for similarity and 0.57 for relatedness). We also
      evaluated the use of neural network based relatedness measures for query
      expansion in a clinical document retrieval task and a biomedical term word sense 
      disambiguation task. We found that, with some limitations, biomedical articles
      may be used in lieu of clinical reports to represent the semantics of clinical
      terms and that distributional semantic methods are useful for clinical and
      biomedical natural language processing applications. AVAILABILITY AND
      IMPLEMENTATION: The software and reference standards used in this study to
      evaluate semantic similarity and relatedness measures are publicly available as
      detailed in the article. CONTACT: pakh0002@umn.eduSupplementary information:

TI  - Deep Artificial Neural Networks and Neuromorphic Chips for Big Data Analysis:
      Pharmaceutical and Bioinformatics Applications.

LID - E1313 [pii]
AB  - Over the past decade, Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) have become the
      state-of-the-art algorithms in Machine Learning (ML), speech recognition,
      computer vision, natural language processing and many other tasks. This was made 
      possible by the advancement in Big Data, Deep Learning (DL) and drastically
      increased chip processing abilities, especially general-purpose graphical
      processing units (GPGPUs). All this has created a growing interest in making the 
      most of the potential offered by DNNs in almost every field. An overview of the
      main architectures of DNNs, and their usefulness in Pharmacology and
      Bioinformatics are presented in this work. The featured applications are: drug
      design, virtual screening (VS), Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship
      (QSAR) research, protein structure prediction and genomics (and other omics) data
      mining. The future need of neuromorphic hardware for DNNs is also discussed, and 
      the two most advanced chips are reviewed: IBM TrueNorth and SpiNNaker. In
      addition, this review points out the importance of considering not only neurons, 
      as DNNs and neuromorphic chips should also include glial cells, given the proven 
      importance of astrocytes, a type of glial cell which contributes to information
      processing in the brain. The Deep Artificial Neuron-Astrocyte Networks (DANAN)
      could overcome the difficulties in architecture design, learning process and
      scalability of the current ML methods.

TI  - Gaining insights from social media language: Methodologies and challenges.
PG  - 507-525
AB  - Language data available through social media provide opportunities to study
      people at an unprecedented scale. However, little guidance is available to
      psychologists who want to enter this area of research. Drawing on tools and
      techniques developed in natural language processing, we first introduce
      psychologists to social media language research, identifying descriptive and
      predictive analyses that language data allow. Second, we describe how raw
      language data can be accessed and quantified for inclusion in subsequent
      analyses, exploring personality as expressed on Facebook to illustrate. Third, we
      highlight challenges and issues to be considered, including accessing and
      processing the data, interpreting effects, and ethical issues. Social media has
      become a valuable part of social life, and there is much we can learn by bringing
      together the tools of computer science with the theories and insights of
      psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Crowdsourcing and curation: perspectives from biology and natural language
      processing.
LID - 10.1093/database/baw115 [doi]
LID - baw115 [pii]
AB  - Crowdsourcing is increasingly utilized for performing tasks in both natural
      language processing and biocuration. Although there have been many applications
      of crowdsourcing in these fields, there have been fewer high-level discussions of
      the methodology and its applicability to biocuration. This paper explores
      crowdsourcing for biocuration through several case studies that highlight
      different ways of leveraging 'the crowd'; these raise issues about the kind(s) of
      expertise needed, the motivations of participants, and questions related to
      feasibility, cost and quality. The paper is an outgrowth of a panel session held 
      at BioCreative V (Seville, September 9-11, 2015). The session consisted of four
      short talks, followed by a discussion. In their talks, the panelists explored the
      role of expertise and the potential to improve crowd performance by training; the
      challenge of decomposing tasks to make them amenable to crowdsourcing; and the
      capture of biological data and metadata through community editing.Database URL:

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) are now broadly used, following decades of
      development and incentive programmes for their use. EHRs have been shown through 
      use of reminders, electronic order sets and other means to improve reliability of
      performance of many basic tasks in acute, preventive and chronic care. They
      assist with collecting, summarising and displaying the large volumes of
      information in patient records and support the implementation of guidelines and
      care pathways. Broad use of EHRs has brought into focus weaknesses of the current
      generation of EHRs: their user interface, implementation difficulties, time
      required to use them and others. Addressing these weaknesses and adopting new
      technologies, including use of voice, natural language processing and data
      analytic techniques, is necessary for EHRs to achieve their full potential: to
      gather information from routine care, to learn from it and to be an integral
      component of efforts to continuously improve and to transform care.

TI  - Event Recognition Based on Deep Learning in Chinese Texts.
PG  - e0160147
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0160147 [doi]
AB  - Event recognition is the most fundamental and critical task in event-based
      natural language processing systems. Existing event recognition methods based on 
      rules and shallow neural networks have certain limitations. For example,
      extracting features using methods based on rules is difficult; methods based on
      shallow neural networks converge too quickly to a local minimum, resulting in low
      recognition precision. To address these problems, we propose the Chinese
      emergency event recognition model based on deep learning (CEERM). Firstly, we use
      a word segmentation system to segment sentences. According to event elements
      labeled in the CEC 2.0 corpus, we classify words into five categories: trigger
      words, participants, objects, time and location. Each word is vectorized
      according to the following six feature layers: part of speech, dependency
      grammar, length, location, distance between trigger word and core word and
      trigger word frequency. We obtain deep semantic features of words by training a
      feature vector set using a deep belief network (DBN), then analyze those features
      in order to identify trigger words by means of a back propagation neural network.
      Extensive testing shows that the CEERM achieves excellent recognition
      performance, with a maximum F-measure value of 85.17%. Moreover, we propose the
      dynamic-supervised DBN, which adds supervised fine-tuning to a restricted
      Boltzmann machine layer by monitoring its training performance. Test analysis
      reveals that the new DBN improves recognition performance and effectively
      controls the training time. Although the F-measure increases to 88.11%, the
      training time increases by only 25.35%.

TI  - Evaluating electronic health record data sources and algorithmic approaches to
      identify hypertensive individuals.
PG  - 162-171
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocw071 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Phenotyping algorithms applied to electronic health record (EHR) data 
      enable investigators to identify large cohorts for clinical and genomic research.
      Algorithm development is often iterative, depends on fallible investigator
      intuition, and is time- and labor-intensive. We developed and evaluated 4 types
      of phenotyping algorithms and categories of EHR information to identify
      hypertensive individuals and controls and provide a portable module for
      implementation at other sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the EHRs of 631
      individuals followed at Vanderbilt for hypertension status. We developed features
      and phenotyping algorithms of increasing complexity. Input categories included
      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD9) codes,
      medications, vital signs, narrative-text search results, and Unified Medical
      Language System (UMLS) concepts extracted using natural language processing
      (NLP). We developed a module and tested portability by replicating 10 of the
      best-performing algorithms at the Marshfield Clinic. RESULTS: Random forests
      using billing codes, medications, vitals, and concepts had the best performance
      with a median area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of
      0.976. Normalized sums of all 4 categories also performed well (0.959 AUC). The
      best non-NLP algorithm combined normalized ICD9 codes, medications, and blood
      pressure readings with a median AUC of 0.948. Blood pressure cutoffs or ICD9 code
      counts alone had AUCs of 0.854 and 0.908, respectively. Marshfield Clinic results
      were similar. CONCLUSION: This work shows that billing codes or blood pressure
      readings alone yield good hypertension classification performance. However, even 
      simple combinations of input categories improve performance. The most complex
      algorithms classified hypertension with excellent recall and precision.

AB  - RATIONALE: Templates in text notes pose challenges for automated information
      extraction algorithms. We propose a method that identifies novel templates in
      plain text medical notes. The identification can then be used to either include
      or exclude templates when processing notes for information extraction. METHODS:
      The two-module method is based on the framework of information foraging and
      addresses the hypothesis that documents containing templates and the templates
      within those documents can be identified by common features. The first module
      takes documents from the corpus and groups those with common templates. This is
      accomplished through a binned word count hierarchical clustering algorithm. The
      second module extracts the templates. It uses the groupings and performs a
      longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to obtain the constituent parts of the
      templates. The method was developed and tested on a random document corpus of 750
      notes derived from a large database of US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
      electronic medical notes. RESULTS: The grouping module, using hierarchical
      clustering, identified 23 groups with 3 documents or more, consisting of 120
      documents from the 750 documents in our test corpus. Of these, 18 groups had at
      least one common template that was present in all documents in the group for a
      positive predictive value of 78%. The LCS extraction module performed with 100%
      positive predictive value, 94% sensitivity, and 83% negative predictive value.
      The human review determined that in 4 groups the template covered the entire
      document, with the remaining 14 groups containing a common section template.
      Among documents with templates, the number of templates per document ranged from 
      1 to 14. The mean and median number of templates per group was 5.9 and 5,
      respectively. DISCUSSION: The grouping method was successful in finding like
      documents containing templates. Of the groups of documents containing templates, 
      the LCS module was successful in deciphering text belonging to the template and
      text that was extraneous. Major obstacles to improved performance included
      documents composed of multiple templates, templates that included other templates
      embedded within them, and variants of templates. We demonstrate proof of concept 
      of the grouping and extraction method of identifying templates in electronic
      medical records in this pilot study and propose methods to improve performance
      and scaling up.

      Question Answering: A Case Study in Alcoholism.
PG  - e24
LID - 10.2196/medinform.5490 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-based question answering (CQA) sites play an important role
      in addressing health information needs. However, a significant number of posted
      questions remain unanswered. Automatically answering the posted questions can
      provide a useful source of information for Web-based health communities.
      OBJECTIVE: In this study, we developed an algorithm to automatically answer
      health-related questions based on past questions and answers (QA). We also aimed 
      to understand information embedded within Web-based health content that are good 
      features in identifying valid answers. METHODS: Our proposed algorithm uses
      information retrieval techniques to identify candidate answers from resolved QA. 
      To rank these candidates, we implemented a semi-supervised leaning algorithm that
      extracts the best answer to a question. We assessed this approach on a curated
      corpus from Yahoo! Answers and compared against a rule-based string similarity
      baseline. RESULTS: On our dataset, the semi-supervised learning algorithm has an 
      accuracy of 86.2%. Unified medical language system-based (health related)
      features used in the model enhance the algorithm's performance by proximately 8%.
      A reasonably high rate of accuracy is obtained given that the data are
      considerably noisy. Important features distinguishing a valid answer from an
      invalid answer include text length, number of stop words contained in a test
      question, a distance between the test question and other questions in the corpus,
      and a number of overlapping health-related terms between questions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Overall, our automated QA system based on historical QA pairs is shown to be
      effective according to the dataset in this case study. It is developed for
      general use in the health care domain, which can also be applied to other CQA
      sites.

AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate enhancement of the chemopreventive
      properties of kimchi by dietary nanosized Lactobacillus (Lab.)plantarum (nLp) in 
      an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis-associated
      colorectal cancer C57BL/6J mouse model. nLp is a dead, shrunken, processed form
      of Lab. Plantarum isolated from kimchi that is 0.5-1.0 microm in size. The
      results obtained showed that animals fed kimchi with nLp (K-nLp) had longer
      colons and lower colon weights/length ratios and developed fewer tumors than mice
      fed kimchi alone (K). In addition, K-nLp administration reduced levels of
      proinflammatory cytokine serum levels and mediated the mRNA and protein
      expressions of inflammatory, apoptotic, and cell-cycle markers to suppress
      inflammation and induce tumor-cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Moreover, it 
      elevated natural killer-cell cytotoxicity. The study suggests adding nLp to
      kimchi could improve the suppressive effect of kimchi on AOM/DSS-induced
      colorectal cancer. These findings indicate nLp has potential use as a functional 
      chemopreventive ingredient in the food industry.

TI  - Popular Nutrition-Related Mobile Apps: A Feature Assessment.
PG  - e85
LID - 10.2196/mhealth.5846 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A key challenge in human nutrition is the assessment of usual food
      intake. This is of particular interest given recent proposals of eHealth
      personalized interventions. The adoption of mobile phones has created an
      opportunity for assessing and improving nutrient intake as they can be used for
      digitalizing dietary assessments and providing feedback. In the last few years,
      hundreds of nutrition-related mobile apps have been launched and installed by
      millions of users. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the main features of the
      most popular nutrition apps and to compare their strategies and technologies for 
      dietary assessment and user feedback. METHODS: Apps were selected from the two
      largest online stores of the most popular mobile operating systems-the Google
      Play Store for Android and the iTunes App Store for iOS-based on popularity as
      measured by the number of installs and reviews. The keywords used in the search
      were as follows: calorie(s), diet, diet tracker, dietician, dietitian, eating,
      fit, fitness, food, food diary, food tracker, health, lose weight, nutrition,
      nutritionist, weight, weight loss, weight management, weight watcher, and ww
      calculator. The inclusion criteria were as follows: English language, minimum
      number of installs (1 million for Google Play Store) or reviews (7500 for iTunes 
      App Store), relation to nutrition (ie, diet monitoring or recommendation), and
      independence from any device (eg, wearable) or subscription. RESULTS: A total of 
      13 apps were classified as popular for inclusion in the analysis. Nine apps
      offered prospective recording of food intake using a food diary feature. Food
      selection was available via text search or barcode scanner technologies. Portion 
      size selection was only textual (ie, without images or icons). All nine of these 
      apps were also capable of collecting physical activity (PA) information using
      self-report, the global positioning system (GPS), or wearable integrations. Their
      outputs focused predominantly on energy balance between dietary intake and PA.
      None of these nine apps offered features directly related to diet plans and
      motivational coaching. In contrast, the remaining four of the 13 apps focused on 
      these opportunities, but without food diaries. One app-FatSecret-also had an
      innovative feature for connecting users with health professionals, and another-S 
      Health-provided a nutrient balance score. CONCLUSIONS: The high number of
      installs indicates that there is a clear interest and opportunity for diet
      monitoring and recommendation using mobile apps. All the apps collecting dietary 
      intake used the same nutrition assessment method (ie, food diary record) and
      technologies for data input (ie, text search and barcode scanner). Emerging
      technologies, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and
      artificial intelligence, were not identified. None of the apps had a decision
      engine capable of providing personalized diet advice.

TI  - Efficient Queries of Stand-off Annotations for Natural Language Processing on
      Electronic Medical Records.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.4137/BII.S38916 [doi]
AB  - In natural language processing, stand-off annotation uses the starting and ending
      positions of an annotation to anchor it to the text and stores the annotation
      content separately from the text. We address the fundamental problem of
      efficiently storing stand-off annotations when applying natural language
      processing on narrative clinical notes in electronic medical records (EMRs) and
      efficiently retrieving such annotations that satisfy position constraints.
      Efficient storage and retrieval of stand-off annotations can facilitate tasks
      such as mapping unstructured text to electronic medical record ontologies. We
      first formulate this problem into the interval query problem, for which optimal
      query/update time is in general logarithm. We next perform a tight time
      complexity analysis on the basic interval tree query algorithm and show its
      nonoptimality when being applied to a collection of 13 query types from Allen's
      interval algebra. We then study two closely related state-of-the-art interval
      query algorithms, proposed query reformulations, and augmentations to the second 
      algorithm. Our proposed algorithm achieves logarithmic time stabbing-max query
      time complexity and solves the stabbing-interval query tasks on all of Allen's
      relations in logarithmic time, attaining the theoretic lower bound. Updating time
      is kept logarithmic and the space requirement is kept linear at the same time. We
      also discuss interval management in external memory models and higher dimensions.

AB  - We have developed a Decision Support Environment (DSE) for medical experts at the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DSE contains two integrated systems:
      The Event-based Text-mining of Health Electronic Records (ETHER) and the
      Pattern-based and Advanced Network Analyzer for Clinical Evaluation and
      Assessment (PANACEA). These systems assist medical experts in reviewing reports
      submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the FDA
      Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). In this manuscript, we describe the DSE
      architecture and key functionalities, and examine its potential contributions to 
      the signal management process by focusing on four use cases: the identification
      of missing cases from a case series, the identification of duplicate case
      reports, retrieving cases for a case series analysis, and community detection for
      signal identification and characterization.

TI  - An Encapsulation of Gene Signatures for Hepatocellular Carcinoma, MicroRNA-132
      Predicted Target Genes and the Corresponding Overlaps.
PG  - e0159498
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159498 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA-132 plays a vital
      part in and is actively associated with several cancers, with its
      tumor-suppressive role in hepatocellular carcinoma confirmed. The current study
      employed multiple bioinformatics techniques to establish gene signatures for
      hepatocellular carcinoma, microRNA-132 predicted target genes and the
      corresponding overlaps. METHODS: Various assays were performed to explore the
      role and cellular functions of miR-132 in HCC and a successive panel of tasks was
      completed, including NLP analysis, miR-132 target genes prediction, comprehensive
      analyses (gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis, network analysis and
      connectivity analysis), and analytical integration. Later, HCC-related and
      miR-132-related potential targets, pathways, networks and highlighted hub genes
      were revealed as well as those of the overlapped section. RESULTS: MiR-132 was
      effective in both impeding cell growth and boosting apoptosis in HCC cell lines. 
      A total of fifty-nine genes were obtained from the analytical integration, which 
      were considered to be both HCC- and miR-132-related. Moreover, four specific
      pathways were unveiled in the network analysis of the overlaps, i.e. adherens
      junction, VEGF signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, and MAPK
      signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The tumor-suppressive role of miR-132 in HCC has 
      been further confirmed by in vitro experiments. Gene signatures in the study
      identified the potential molecular mechanisms of HCC, miR-132 and their
      established associations, which might be effective for diagnosis, individualized 
      treatments and prognosis of HCC patients. However, combined detections of miR-132
      with other bio-indicators in clinical practice and further in vitro experiments
      are needed.

TI  - Establishing a baseline for literature mining human genetic variants and their
      relationships to disease cohorts.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1186/s12911-016-0294-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Variome corpus, a small collection of published articles about
      inherited colorectal cancer, includes annotations of 11 entity types and 13
      relation types related to the curation of the relationship between genetic
      variation and disease. Due to the richness of these annotations, the corpus
      provides a good testbed for evaluation of biomedical literature information
      extraction systems. METHODS: In this paper, we focus on assessing performance on 
      extracting the relations in the corpus, using gold standard entities as a
      starting point, to establish a baseline for extraction of relations important for
      extraction of genetic variant information from the literature. We test the
      application of the Public Knowledge Discovery Engine for Java (PKDE4J) system, a 
      natural language processing system designed for information extraction of
      entities and relations in text, on the relation extraction task using this
      corpus. RESULTS: For the relations which are attested at least 100 times in the
      Variome corpus, we realise a performance ranging from 0.78-0.84
      Precision-weighted F-score, depending on the relation. We find that the PKDE4J
      system adapted straightforwardly to the range of relation types represented in
      the corpus; some extensions to the original methodology were required to adapt to
      the multi-relational classification context. The results are competitive with
      state-of-the-art relation extraction performance on more heavily studied corpora,
      although the analysis shows that the Recall of a co-occurrence baseline outweighs
      the benefit of improved Precision for many relations, indicating the value of
      simple semantic constraints on relations. CONCLUSIONS: This work represents the
      first attempt to apply relation extraction methods to the Variome corpus. The
      results demonstrate that automated methods have good potential to structure the
      information expressed in the published literature related to genetic variants,
      connecting mutations to genes, diseases, and patient cohorts. Further development
      of such approaches will facilitate more efficient biocuration of genetic variant 
      information into structured databases, leveraging the knowledge embedded in the
      vast publication literature.

TI  - Developing an Algorithm to Detect Early Childhood Obesity in Two Tertiary
      Pediatric Medical Centers.
PG  - 693-706
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2016-01-RA-0015 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop an algorithm to accurately
      identify children with severe early onset childhood obesity (ages 1-5.99 years)
      using structured and unstructured data from the electronic health record (EHR).
      INTRODUCTION: Childhood obesity increases risk factors for cardiovascular
      morbidity and vascular disease. Accurate definition of a high precision phenotype
      through a standardize tool is critical to the success of large-scale genomic
      studies and validating rare monogenic variants causing severe early onset
      obesity. DATA AND METHODS: Rule based and machine learning based algorithms were 
      developed using structured and unstructured data from two EHR databases from
      Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical
      Center (CCHMC). Exclusion criteria including medications or comorbid diagnoses
      were defined. Machine learning algorithms were developed using cross-site
      training and testing in addition to experimenting with natural language
      processing features. RESULTS: Precision was emphasized for a high fidelity
      cohort. The rule-based algorithm performed the best overall, 0.895 (CCHMC) and
      0.770 (BCH). The best feature set for machine learning employed Unified Medical
      Language System (UMLS) concept unique identifiers (CUIs), ICD-9 codes, and RxNorm
      codes. CONCLUSIONS: Detecting severe early childhood obesity is essential for the
      intervention potential in children at the highest long-term risk of developing
      comorbidities related to obesity and excluding patients with underlying
      pathological and non-syndromic causes of obesity assists in developing a
      high-precision cohort for genetic study. Further such phenotyping efforts inform 
      future practical application in health care environments utilizing clinical
      decision support.

LID - 10.1136/jclinpath-2016-203872 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Encoded pathology data are key for medical registries and analyses,
      but pathology information is often expressed as free text. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed
      and assessed the use of NLP (natural language processing) for encoding pathology 
      documents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Papers addressing NLP in pathology were
      retrieved from PubMed, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library 
      and Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Anthology. We reviewed and
      summarised the study objectives; NLP methods used and their validation; software 
      implementations; the performance on the dataset used and any reported use in
      practice. RESULTS: The main objectives of the 38 included papers were encoding
      and extraction of clinically relevant information from pathology reports. Common 
      approaches were word/phrase matching, probabilistic machine learning and
      rule-based systems. Five papers (13%) compared different methods on the same
      dataset. Four papers did not specify the method(s) used. 18 of the 26 studies
      that reported F-measure, recall or precision reported values of over 0.9.
      Proprietary software was the most frequently mentioned category (14 studies);
      General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) was the most applied
      architecture overall. Practical system use was reported in four papers. Most
      papers used expert annotation validation. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods are used
      in NLP research in pathology, and good performances, that is, high precision and 
      recall, high retrieval/removal rates, are reported for all of these. Lack of
      validation and of shared datasets precludes performance comparison. More
      comparative analysis and validation are needed to provide better insight into the
      performance and merits of these methods.

LID - 10.3389/fpls.2016.00906 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular recognition of pathogens by plants constitutes an important early
      detection system in plant immunity. Microbe-derived molecules, also named
      patterns, can be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the host
      cell membrane that trigger plant immune responses. Most knowledge on
      extracellular pathogen detection by plants comes from research on bacterial and
      fungal pathogens. For oomycetes, that comprise some of the most destructive plant
      pathogens, mechanisms of extracellular pattern recognition have only emerged
      recently. These include newly recognized patterns, e.g., cellulose-binding
      elicitor lectin, necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins (NLPs),
      and glycoside hydrolase 12, as well as their receptors, e.g., the putative
      elicitin PRR elicitin response and the NLP PRR receptor-like protein 23. Immunity
      can also be triggered by the release of endogenous host-derived patterns, as a
      result of oomycete enzymes or damage. In this review we will describe the types
      of patterns, both pathogen-derived exogenous and plant-derived endogenous ones,
      and what is known about their extracellular detection during (hemi-)biotrophic
      oomycete infection of plants.

AB  - Source-sink dynamics affects population connectivity, spatial genetic structure
      and population viability for many species. We introduce a novel approach that
      uses individual-based genetic graphs to identify source-sink areas within a
      continuously distributed population of black bears (Ursus americanus) in the
      northern lower peninsula (NLP) of Michigan, USA. Black bear harvest samples (n = 
      569, from 2002, 2006 and 2010) were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci and
      locations were compared across years to identify areas of consistent occupancy
      over time. We compared graph metrics estimated for a genetic model with metrics
      from 10 ecological models to identify ecological factors that were associated
      with sources and sinks. We identified 62 source nodes, 16 of which represent
      important source areas (net flux > 0.7) and 79 sink nodes. Source strength was
      significantly correlated with bear local harvest density (a proxy for bear
      density) and habitat suitability. Additionally, resampling simulations showed our
      approach is robust to potential sampling bias from uneven sample dispersion.
      Findings demonstrate black bears in the NLP exhibit asymmetric gene flow, and
      individual-based genetic graphs can characterize source-sink dynamics in
      continuously distributed species in the absence of discrete habitat patches. Our 
      findings warrant consideration of undetected source-sink dynamics and their
      implications on harvest management of game species.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Machine learning techniques for the text mining of
      cancer-related clinical documents have not been sufficiently explored. Here some 
      techniques are presented for the pre-processing of free-text breast cancer
      pathology reports, with the aim of facilitating the extraction of information
      relevant to cancer staging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first technique was
      implemented using the freely available software RapidMiner to classify the
      reports according to their general layout: 'semi-structured' and 'unstructured'. 
      The second technique was developed using the open source language engineering
      framework GATE and aimed at the prediction of chunks of the report text
      containing information pertaining to the cancer morphology, the tumour size, its 
      hormone receptor status and the number of positive nodes. The classifiers were
      trained and tested respectively on sets of 635 and 163 manually classified or
      annotated reports, from the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry. RESULTS: The best
      result of 99.4% accuracy - which included only one semi-structured report
      predicted as unstructured - was produced by the layout classifier with the k
      nearest algorithm, using the binary term occurrence word vector type with
      stopword filter and pruning. For chunk recognition, the best results were found
      using the PAUM algorithm with the same parameters for all cases, except for the
      prediction of chunks containing cancer morphology. For semi-structured reports
      the performance ranged from 0.97 to 0.94 and from 0.92 to 0.83 in precision and
      recall, while for unstructured reports performance ranged from 0.91 to 0.64 and
      from 0.68 to 0.41 in precision and recall. Poor results were found when the
      classifier was trained on semi-structured reports but tested on unstructured.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results show that it is possible and beneficial to predict the
      layout of reports and that the accuracy of prediction of which segments of a
      report may contain certain information is sensitive to the report layout and the 
      type of information sought.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because adverse drug events (ADEs) are a serious health problem and a 
      leading cause of death, it is of vital importance to identify them correctly and 
      in a timely manner. With the development of Web 2.0, social media has become a
      large data source for information on ADEs. The objective of this study is to
      develop a relation extraction system that uses natural language processing
      techniques to effectively distinguish between ADEs and non-ADEs in informal text 
      on social media. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We develop a feature-based approach that 
      utilizes various lexical, syntactic, and semantic features.
      Information-gain-based feature selection is performed to address high-dimensional
      features. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of four well-known kernel-based
      approaches (i.e., subset tree kernel, tree kernel, shortest dependency path
      kernel, and all-paths graph kernel) and several ensembles that are generated by
      adopting different combination methods (i.e., majority voting, weighted
      averaging, and stacked generalization). All of the approaches are tested using
      three data sets: two health-related discussion forums and one general social
      networking site (i.e., Twitter). RESULTS: When investigating the contribution of 
      each feature subset, the feature-based approach attains the best area under the
      receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) values, which are 78.6%, 72.2%,
      and 79.2% on the three data sets. When individual methods are used, we attain the
      best AUC values of 82.1%, 73.2%, and 77.0% using the subset tree kernel, shortest
      dependency path kernel, and feature-based approach on the three data sets,
      respectively. When using classifier ensembles, we achieve the best AUC values of 
      84.5%, 77.3%, and 84.5% on the three data sets, outperforming the baselines.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental results indicate that ADE extraction from social
      media can benefit from feature selection. With respect to the effectiveness of
      different feature subsets, lexical features and semantic features can enhance the
      ADE extraction capability. Kernel-based approaches, which can stay away from the 
      feature sparsity issue, are qualified to address the ADE extraction problem.
      Combining different individual classifiers using suitable combination methods can
      further enhance the ADE extraction effectiveness.

      causes mitotic defects and impairs embryonic development.
PG  - 1040-51
LID - 10.1242/bio.019638 [doi]
AB  - The centrosome-associated proteins Ninein (Nin) and Ninein-like protein (Nlp)
      play significant roles in microtubule stability, nucleation and anchoring at the 
      centrosome in mammalian cells. Here, we investigate Blastoderm specific gene 25D 
      (Bsg25D), which encodes the only Drosophila protein that is closely related to
      Nin and Nlp. In early embryos, we find that Bsg25D mRNA and Bsg25D protein are
      closely associated with centrosomes and astral microtubules. We show that
      sequences within the coding region and 3'UTR of Bsg25D mRNAs are important for
      proper localization of this transcript in oogenesis and embryogenesis. Ectopic
      expression of eGFP-Bsg25D from an unlocalized mRNA disrupts microtubule polarity 
      in mid-oogenesis and compromises the distribution of the axis polarity
      determinant Gurken. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we
      show that an N-terminal fragment of Bsg25D can bind microtubules in vitro and can
      move along them, predominantly toward minus-ends. While flies homozygous for a
      Bsg25D null mutation are viable and fertile, 70% of embryos lacking maternal and 
      zygotic Bsg25D do not hatch and exhibit chromosome segregation defects, as well
      as detachment of centrosomes from mitotic spindles. We conclude that Bsg25D is a 
      centrosomal protein that, while dispensable for viability, nevertheless helps
      ensure the integrity of mitotic divisions in Drosophila.

      Stability and Cellular Uptake.
PG  - 20549-57
LID - 10.1021/acsami.6b04609 [doi]
AB  - Nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) consist of a discoidal phospholipid lipid
      bilayer confined by an apolipoprotein belt. NLPs are a promising platform for a
      variety of biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility, size, definable
      composition, and amphipathic characteristics. However, poor serum stability
      hampers the use of NLPs for in vivo applications such as drug formulation. In
      this study, NLP stability was enhanced upon the incorporation and subsequent
      UV-mediated intermolecular cross-linking of photoactive DiynePC phospholipids in 
      the lipid bilayer, forming cross-linked nanoparticles (X-NLPs). Both the
      concentration of DiynePC in the bilayer and UV exposure time significantly
      affected the resulting X-NLP stability in 100% serum, as assessed by size
      exclusion chromatography (SEC) of fluorescently labeled particles. Cross-linking 
      did not significantly impact the size of X-NLPs as determined by dynamic light
      scattering and SEC. X-NLPs had essentially no degradation over 48 h in 100%
      serum, which is a drastic improvement compared to non-cross-linked NLPs (50%
      degradation by approximately 10 min). X-NLPs had greater uptake into the human
      ATCC 5637 bladder cancer cell line compared to non-cross-linked particles,
      indicating their potential utility for targeted drug delivery. X-NLPs also
      exhibited enhanced stability following intravenous administration in mice. These 
      results collectively support the potential utility of X-NLPs for a variety of in 
      vivo applications.

AB  - A national German funding initiative for Medical Informatics focusing at data
      integration for medicine gives an opportunity to reopen a window to Germany. In
      the open window appears a best paper selection of the 2015 annual conference of
      the German Society of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology and papers
      of the German journal GMS Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (MIBE). 
      The publications in focus deal with data integration by transferring clinical
      routine data into an electronic data capture (EDC) system, using natural language
      processing to make unstructured date processable, measuring quality of record
      linkage, and by using a unified metadata scheme for integrated documentation in
      laboratories. Two additional papers present methods for data analysis especially 
      for change point detection in binary sequences and for analyzing categorial data.

TI  - Automated Classification of Selected Data Elements from Free-text Diagnostic
      Reports for Clinical Research.
PG  - 373-80
LID - 10.3414/ME15-02-0019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the Multiple Myeloma clinical registry at Heidelberg University
      Hospital, most data are extracted from discharge letters. Our aim was to analyze 
      if it is possible to make the manual documentation process more efficient by
      using methods of natural language processing for multiclass classification of
      free-text diagnostic reports to automatically document the diagnosis and state of
      disease of myeloma patients. The first objective was to create a corpus
      consisting of free-text diagnosis paragraphs of patients with multiple myeloma
      from German diagnostic reports, and its manual annotation of relevant data
      elements by documentation specialists. The second objective was to construct and 
      evaluate a framework using different NLP methods to enable automatic multiclass
      classification of relevant data elements from free-text diagnostic reports.
      METHODS: The main diagnoses paragraph was extracted from the clinical report of
      one third randomly selected patients of the multiple myeloma research database
      from Heidelberg University Hospital (in total 737 selected patients). An EDC
      system was setup and two data entry specialists performed independently a manual 
      documentation of at least nine specific data elements for multiple myeloma
      characterization. Both data entries were compared and assessed by a third
      specialist and an annotated text corpus was created. A framework was constructed,
      consisting of a self-developed package to split multiple diagnosis sequences into
      several subsequences, four different preprocessing steps to normalize the input
      data and two classifiers: a maximum entropy classifier (MEC) and a support vector
      machine (SVM). In total 15 different pipelines were examined and assessed by a
      ten-fold cross-validation, reiterated 100 times. For quality indication the
      average error rate and the average F1-score were conducted. For significance
      testing the approximate randomization test was used. RESULTS: The created
      annotated corpus consists of 737 different diagnoses paragraphs with a total
      number of 865 coded diagnosis. The dataset is publicly available in the
      supplementary online files for training and testing of further NLP methods. Both 
      classifiers showed low average error rates (MEC: 1.05; SVM: 0.84) and high
      F1-scores (MEC: 0.89; SVM: 0.92). However the results varied widely depending on 
      the classified data element. Preprocessing methods increased this effect and had 
      significant impact on the classification, both positive and negative. The
      automatic diagnosis splitter increased the average error rate significantly, even
      if the F1-score decreased only slightly. CONCLUSIONS: The low average error rates
      and high average F1-scores of each pipeline demonstrate the suitability of the
      investigated NPL methods. However, it was also shown that there is no best
      practice for an automatic classification of data elements from free-text
      diagnostic reports.

TI  - Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze? Costs and Benefits of Multiple Human Annotators
      for Clinical Text De-identification.
PG  - 356-64
LID - 10.3414/ME15-01-0122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical text contains valuable information but must be de-identified
      before it can be used for secondary purposes. Accurate annotation of personally
      identifiable information (PII) is essential to the development of automated
      de-identification systems and to manual redaction of PII. Yet the accuracy of
      annotations may vary considerably across individual annotators and annotation is 
      costly. As such, the marginal benefit of incorporating additional annotators has 
      not been well characterized. OBJECTIVES: This study models the costs and benefits
      of incorporating increasing numbers of independent human annotators to identify
      the instances of PII in a corpus. We used a corpus with gold standard annotations
      to evaluate the performance of teams of annotators of increasing size. METHODS:
      Four annotators independently identified PII in a 100-document corpus consisting 
      of randomly selected clinical notes from Family Practice clinics in a large
      integrated health care system. These annotations were pooled and validated to
      generate a gold standard corpus for evaluation. RESULTS: Recall rates for all PII
      types ranged from 0.90 to 0.98 for individual annotators to 0.998 to 1.0 for
      teams of three, when meas-ured against the gold standard. Median cost per PII
      instance discovered during corpus annotation ranged from $ 0.71 for an individual
      annotator to $ 377 for annotations discovered only by a fourth annotator.
      CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating a second annotator into a PII annotation process
      reduces unredacted PII and improves the quality of annotations to 0.99 recall,
      yielding clear benefit at reasonable cost; the cost advantages of annotation
      teams larger than two diminish rapidly.

TI  - Detecting the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter and urinary symptoms in 
      hospitalized patients using natural language processing.
LID - S1532-0464(16)30066-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2016.07.012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a natural language processing pipeline to extract
      positively asserted concepts related to the presence of an indwelling urinary
      catheter in hospitalized patients from the free text of the electronic medical
      note. The goal is to assist infection preventionists and other healthcare
      professionals in determining whether a patient has an indwelling urinary catheter
      when a catheter-associated urinary tract infection is suspected. Currently, data 
      on indwelling urinary catheters is not consistently captured in the electronic
      medical record in structured format and thus cannot be reliably extracted for
      clinical and research purposes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a lexicon of 
      terms related to indwelling urinary catheters and urinary symptoms based on
      domain knowledge, prior experience in the field, and review of medical notes. A
      reference standard of 1595 randomly selected documents from inpatient admissions 
      was annotated by human reviewers to identify all positively and negatively
      asserted concepts related to indwelling urinary catheters. We trained a natural
      language processing pipeline based on the V3NLP framework using 1050 documents
      and tested on 545 documents to determine agreement with the human reference
      standard. Metrics reported are positive predictive value and recall. RESULTS: The
      lexicon contained 590 terms related to the presence of an indwelling urinary
      catheter in various categories including insertion, care, change, and removal of 
      urinary catheters and 67 terms for urinary symptoms. Nursing notes were the most 
      frequent inpatient note titles in the reference standard document corpus; these
      also yielded the highest number of positively asserted concepts with respect to
      urinary catheters. Comparing the performance of the natural language processing
      pipeline against the human reference standard, the overall recall was 75% and
      positive predictive value was 99% on the training set; on the testing set, the
      recall was 72% and positive predictive value was 98%. The performance on
      extracting urinary symptoms (including fever) was high with recall and precision 
      greater than 90%. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that it is possible to identify the 
      presence of an indwelling urinary catheter and urinary symptoms from the free
      text of electronic medical notes from inpatients using natural language
      processing. These are two key steps in developing automated protocols to assist
      humans in large-scale review of patient charts for catheter-associated urinary
      tract infection. The challenges associated with extracting indwelling urinary
      catheter-related concepts also inform the design of electronic medical record
      templates to reliably and consistently capture data on indwelling urinary
      catheters.

      endocrine neoplasia type 2B.
PG  - 449-54
LID - 10.1177/2050640615611630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms are frequent in multiple endocrine
      neoplasia (MEN) 2B and may be related to megacolon. OBJECTIVE: The objective of
      this article is to review the clinical features of patients with MEN 2B,
      particularly megacolon. METHODS: We used natural language processing of
      electronic medical records of Mayo Clinic patients over 20 years: Eight patients 
      with definite MEN 2B were identified; of these, four had megacolon. From these
      patients' records, three others with paper medical records were identified
      through familial association. We used a standard data sheet to identify features 
      of the disease with particular emphasis on megacolon. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients
      identified with MEN 2B, seven (63%) had megacolon, typically presenting with
      constipation in infancy or megacolon in childhood. In addition, three patients
      had esophageal manifestations (two achalasia and one Zenker's diverticulum).
      Megacolon often required surgical intervention for intractable constipation,
      abdominal distension and discomfort. Histopathological features of resected colon
      revealed enteric and extrinsic nerve hyperplasia and ganglioneuromas of the
      submucosal and myenteric plexuses. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with MEN 2B, 63%
      had megacolon. Significant esophageal motor disorders in MEN 2B may affect
      approximately 25% of patients. Any presentation with megacolon should trigger a
      search for MEN 2B in order to identify the potentially fatal endocrine tumors.

TI  - Extracting Information from Electronic Medical Records to Identify the Obesity
      Status of a Patient Based on Comorbidities and Bodyweight Measures.
PG  - 191
LID - 10.1007/s10916-016-0548-8 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a chronic disease with an increasing impact on the world's population.
      In this work, we present a method of identifying obesity automatically using text
      mining techniques and information related to body weight measures and obesity
      comorbidities. We used a dataset of 3015 de-identified medical records that
      contain labels for two classification problems. The first classification problem 
      distinguishes between obesity, overweight, normal weight, and underweight. The
      second classification problem differentiates between obesity types: super
      obesity, morbid obesity, severe obesity and moderate obesity. We used a Bag of
      Words approach to represent the records together with unigram and bigram
      representations of the features. We implemented two approaches: a hierarchical
      method and a nonhierarchical one. We used Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes 
      together with ten-fold cross validation to evaluate and compare performances. Our
      results indicate that the hierarchical approach does not work as well as the
      nonhierarchical one. In general, our results show that Support Vector Machine
      obtains better performances than Naive Bayes for both classification problems. We
      also observed that bigram representation improves performance compared with
      unigram representation.

TI  - Automatic Classification of Ultrasound Screening Examinations of the Abdominal
      Aorta.
PG  - 742-748
AB  - Our work facilitates the identification of veterans who may be at risk for
      abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) based on the 2007 mandate to screen all veteran 
      patients that meet the screening criteria. The main research objective is to
      automatically index three clinical conditions: pertinent negative AAA, pertinent 
      positive AAA, and visually unacceptable image exams. We developed and evaluated a
      ConText-based algorithm with the GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering)
      development system to automatically classify 1402 ultrasound radiology reports
      for AAA screening. Using the results from JAPE (Java Annotation Pattern Engine)
      transducer rules, we developed a feature vector to classify the radiology reports
      with a decision table classifier. We found that ConText performed optimally on
      precision and recall for pertinent negative (0.99 (0.98-0.99), 0.99 (0.99-1.00)) 
      and pertinent positive AAA detection (0.98 (0.95-1.00), 0.97 (0.92-1.00)), and
      respectably for determination of non-diagnostic image studies (0.85 (0.77-0.91), 
      0.96 (0.91-0.99)). In addition, our algorithm can determine the AAA size
      measurements for further characterization of abnormality. We developed and
      evaluated a regular expression based algorithm using GATE for determining the
      three contextual conditions: pertinent negative, pertinent positive, and
      non-diagnostic from radiology reports obtained for evaluating the presence or
      absence of abdominal aortic aneurysm. ConText performed very well at identifying 
      the contextual features. Our study also discovered contextual trigger terms to
      detect sub-standard ultrasound image quality. Limitations of performance included
      unknown dictionary terms, complex sentences, and vague findings that were
      difficult to classify and properly code.

TI  - Show and Tell: Lessons learned from the 2015 MSCOCO Image Captioning Challenge.
AB  - Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in
      artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language
      processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep
      recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and
      machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing
      an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target
      description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets
      show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely
      from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both 
      qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, given the recent surge of interest in 
      this task, a competition was organized in 2015 using the newly released COCO
      dataset. We describe and analyze the various improvements we applied to our own
      baseline and show the resulting performance in the competition, which we won
      ex-aequo with a team from Microsoft Research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a system we developed that connects natural language
      processing (NLP) for information extraction from narrative text mammography
      reports with a Bayesian network for decision-support about breast cancer
      diagnosis. The ultimate goal of this system is to provide decision support as
      part of the workflow of producing the radiology report. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      built a system that uses an NLP information extraction system (which extract
      BI-RADS descriptors and clinical information from mammography reports) to provide
      the necessary inputs to a Bayesian network (BN) decision support system (DSS)
      that estimates lesion malignancy from BI-RADS descriptors. We used this
      integrated system to predict diagnosis of breast cancer from radiology text
      reports and evaluated it with a reference standard of 300 mammography reports. We
      collected two different outputs from the DSS: (1) the probability of malignancy
      and (2) the BI-RADS final assessment category. Since NLP may produce imperfect
      inputs to the DSS, we compared the difference between using perfect ("reference
      standard") structured inputs to the DSS ("RS-DSS") vs NLP-derived inputs
      ("NLP-DSS") on the output of the DSS using the concordance correlation
      coefficient. We measured the classification accuracy of the BI-RADS final
      assessment category when using NLP-DSS, compared with the ground truth category
      established by the radiologist. RESULTS: The NLP-DSS and RS-DSS had closely
      matched probabilities, with a mean paired difference of 0.004+/-0.025. The
      concordance correlation of these paired measures was 0.95. The accuracy of the
      NLP-DSS to predict the correct BI-RADS final assessment category was 97.58%.
      CONCLUSION: The accuracy of the information extracted from mammography reports
      using the NLP system was sufficient to provide accurate DSS results. We believe
      our system could ultimately reduce the variation in practice in mammography
      related to assessment of malignant lesions and improve management decisions.

TI  - Toward a Learning Health-care System - Knowledge Delivery at the Point of Care
      Empowered by Big Data and NLP.
PG  - 13-22
LID - 10.4137/BII.S37977 [doi]
AB  - The concept of optimizing health care by understanding and generating knowledge
      from previous evidence, ie, the Learning Health-care System (LHS), has gained
      momentum and now has national prominence. Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of
      electronic health records (EHRs) enables the data collection required to form the
      basis for facilitating LHS. A prerequisite for using EHR data within the LHS is
      an infrastructure that enables access to EHR data longitudinally for health-care 
      analytics and real time for knowledge delivery. Additionally, significant
      clinical information is embedded in the free text, making natural language
      processing (NLP) an essential component in implementing an LHS. Herein, we share 
      our institutional implementation of a big data-empowered clinical NLP
      infrastructure, which not only enables health-care analytics but also has
      real-time NLP processing capability. The infrastructure has been utilized for
      multiple institutional projects including the MayoExpertAdvisor, an
      individualized care recommendation solution for clinical care. We compared the
      advantages of big data over two other environments. Big data infrastructure
      significantly outperformed other infrastructure in terms of computing speed,
      demonstrating its value in making the LHS a possibility in the near future.

AB  - Reports an error in "Initial Investigation Into Computer Scoring of Candidate
      Essays for Personnel Selection" by Michael C. Campion, Michael A. Campion, Emily 
      D. Campion and Matthew H. Reider (Journal of Applied Psychology, Advanced Online 
      Publication, Apr 14, 2016, np). In the article the affiliations for Emily D.
      Campion and Matthew H. Reider were originally incorrect. All versions of this
      article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article
      appeared in record 2016-18130-001.) Emerging advancements including the
      exponentially growing availability of computer-collected data and increasingly
      sophisticated statistical software have led to a "Big Data Movement" wherein
      organizations have begun attempting to use large-scale data analysis to improve
      their effectiveness. Yet, little is known regarding how organizations can
      leverage these advancements to develop more effective personnel selection
      procedures, especially when the data are unstructured (text-based). Drawing on
      literature on natural language processing, we critically examine the possibility 
      of leveraging advances in text mining and predictive modeling computer software
      programs as a surrogate for human raters in a selection context. We explain how
      to "train" a computer program to emulate a human rater when scoring
      accomplishment records. We then examine the reliability of the computer's scores,
      provide preliminary evidence of their construct validity, demonstrate that this
      practice does not produce scores that disadvantage minority groups, illustrate
      the positive financial impact of adopting this practice in an organization (N
      approximately 46,000 candidates), and discuss implementation issues. Finally, we 
      discuss the potential implications of using computer scoring to address the
      adverse impact-validity dilemma. We suggest that it may provide a cost-effective 
      means of using predictors that have comparable validity but have previously been 
      too expensive for large-scale screening. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Performance of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tool to Extract Pulmonary
      Function Test (PFT) Reports from Structured and Semistructured Veteran Affairs
      (VA) Data.
PG  - 1217
LID - 10.13063/2327-9214.1217 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are objective estimates
      of lung function, but are not reliably stored within the Veteran Health Affairs
      data systems as structured data. The aim of this study was to validate the
      natural language processing (NLP) tool we developed-which extracts spirometric
      values and responses to bronchodilator administration-against expert review, and 
      to estimate the number of additional spirometric tests identified beyond the
      structured data. METHODS: All patients at seven Veteran Affairs Medical Centers
      with a diagnostic code for asthma Jan 1, 2006-Dec 31, 2012 were included.
      Evidence of spirometry with a bronchodilator challenge (BDC) was extracted from
      structured data as well as clinical documents. NLP's performance was compared
      against a human reference standard using a random sample of 1,001 documents.
      RESULTS: In the validation set NLP demonstrated a precision of 98.9 percent (95
      percent confidence intervals (CI): 93.9 percent, 99.7 percent), recall of 97.8
      percent (95 percent CI: 92.2 percent, 99.7 percent), and an F-measure of 98.3
      percent for the forced vital capacity pre- and post pairs and precision of 100
      percent (95 percent CI: 96.6 percent, 100 percent), recall of 100 percent (95
      percent CI: 96.6 percent, 100 percent), and an F-measure of 100 percent for the
      forced expiratory volume in one second pre- and post pairs for bronchodilator
      administration. Application of the NLP increased the proportion identified with
      complete bronchodilator challenge by 25 percent. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This
      technology can improve identification of PFTs for epidemiologic research. Caution
      must be taken in assuming that a single domain of clinical data can completely
      capture the scope of a disease, treatment, or clinical test.

TI  - Mining Health-Related Issues in Consumer Product Reviews by Using Scalable Text
      Analytics.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.4137/BII.S37791 [doi]
AB  - In an era when most of our life activities are digitized and recorded,
      opportunities abound to gain insights about population health. Online product
      reviews present a unique data source that is currently underexplored.
      Health-related information, although scarce, can be systematically mined in
      online product reviews. Leveraging natural language processing and machine
      learning tools, we were able to mine 1.3 million grocery product reviews for
      health-related information. The objectives of the study were as follows: (1)
      conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis on the types of health issues found
      in consumer product reviews; (2) develop a machine learning classifier to detect 
      reviews that contain health-related issues; and (3) gain insights about the task 
      characteristics and challenges for text analytics to guide future research.

TI  - Normalizing acronyms and abbreviations to aid patient understanding of clinical
      texts: ShARe/CLEF eHealth Challenge 2013, Task 2.
PG  - 43
LID - 10.1186/s13326-016-0084-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ShARe/CLEF eHealth challenge lab aims to stimulate development of
      natural language processing and information retrieval technologies to aid
      patients in understanding their clinical reports. In clinical text, acronyms and 
      abbreviations, also referenced as short forms, can be difficult for patients to
      understand. For one of three shared tasks in 2013 (Task 2), we generated a
      reference standard of clinical short forms normalized to the Unified Medical
      Language System. This reference standard can be used to improve patient
      understanding by linking to web sources with lay descriptions of annotated short 
      forms or by substituting short forms with a more simplified, lay term. METHODS:
      In this study, we evaluate 1) accuracy of participating systems' normalizing
      short forms compared to a majority sense baseline approach, 2) performance of
      participants' systems for short forms with variable majority sense distributions,
      and 3) report the accuracy of participating systems' normalizing shared
      normalized concepts between the test set and the Consumer Health Vocabulary, a
      vocabulary of lay medical terms. RESULTS: The best systems submitted by the five 
      participating teams performed with accuracies ranging from 43 to 72 %. A majority
      sense baseline approach achieved the second best performance. The performance of 
      participating systems for normalizing short forms with two or more senses with
      low ambiguity (majority sense greater than 80 %) ranged from 52 to 78 % accuracy,
      with two or more senses with moderate ambiguity (majority sense between 50 and 80
      %) ranged from 23 to 57 % accuracy, and with two or more senses with high
      ambiguity (majority sense less than 50 %) ranged from 2 to 45 % accuracy. With
      respect to the ShARe test set, 69 % of short form annotations contained common
      concept unique identifiers with the Consumer Health Vocabulary. For these 2594
      possible annotations, the performance of participating systems ranged from 50 to 
      75 % accuracy. CONCLUSION: Short form normalization continues to be a challenging
      problem. Short form normalization systems perform with moderate to reasonable
      accuracies. The Consumer Health Vocabulary could enrich its knowledge base with
      missed concept unique identifiers from the ShARe test set to further support
      patient understanding of unfamiliar medical terms.

TI  - Imaging Informatics: 25 Years of Progress.
PG  - S23-31
LID - 10.15265/IYS-2016-s004 [doi]
AB  - The science and applications of informatics in medical imaging have advanced
      dramatically in the past 25 years. This article provides a selective overview of 
      key developments in medical imaging informatics. Advances in standards and
      technologies for compression and transmission of digital images have enabled
      Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) and teleradiology. Research
      in speech recognition, structured reporting, ontologies, and natural language
      processing has improved the ability to generate and analyze the reports of
      imaging procedures. Informatics has provided tools to address workflow and
      ergonomic issues engendered by the growing volume of medical image information.
      Research in computeraided detection and diagnosis of abnormalities in medical
      images has opened new avenues to improve patient care. The growing number of
      medical-imaging examinations and their large volumes of information create a
      natural platform for "big data" analytics, particularly when joined with
      high-dimensional genomic data. Radiogenomics investigates relationships between a
      disease's genetic and gene-expression characteristics and its imaging phenotype; 
      this emerging field promises to help us better understand disease biology,
      prognosis, and treatment options. The next 25 years offer remarkable
      opportunities for informatics and medical imaging together to lead to further
      advances in both disciplines and to improve health.

TI  - What evidence is there for a delay in diagnostic coding of RA in UK general
      practice records? An observational study of free text.
PG  - e010393
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010393 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Much research with electronic health records (EHRs) uses coded or
      structured data only; important information captured in the free text remains
      unused. One dimension of EHR data quality assessment is 'currency' or timeliness,
      that is, data are representative of the patient state at the time of measurement.
      We explored the use of free text in UK general practice patient records to
      evaluate delays in recording of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis. We also
      aimed to locate and quantify disease and diagnostic information recorded only in 
      text. SETTING: UK general practice patient records from the Clinical Practice
      Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: 294 individuals with incident diagnosis of RA
      between 2005 and 2008; 204 women and 85 men, median age 63 years. PRIMARY AND
      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of (1) quantity and timing of text entries
      for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as a proxy for the RA disease 
      code, and (2) quantity, location and timing of free text information relating to 
      RA onset and diagnosis. RESULTS: Inflammatory markers, pain and DMARDs were the
      most common categories of disease information in text prior to RA diagnostic
      code; 10-37% of patients had such information only in text. Read codes associated
      with RA-related text included correspondence, general consultation and arthritis 
      codes. 64 patients (22%) had DMARD text entries >14 days prior to RA code; these 
      patients had more and earlier referrals to rheumatology, tests, swelling, pain
      and DMARD prescriptions, suggestive of an earlier implicit diagnosis than was
      recorded by the diagnostic code. CONCLUSIONS: RA-related symptoms, tests,
      referrals and prescriptions were recorded in free text with 22% of patients
      showing strong evidence of delay in coding of diagnosis. Researchers using EHRs
      may need to mitigate for delayed codes by incorporating text into their
      case-ascertainment strategies. Natural language processing techniques have the
      capability to do this at scale.

TI  - A comparison between physicians and computer algorithms for form CMS-2728 data
      reporting.
PG  - 117-124
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12445 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: CMS-2728 form (Medical Evidence Report) assesses 23 comorbidities
      chosen to reflect poor outcomes and increased mortality risk. Previous studies
      questioned the validity of physician reporting on forms CMS-2728. We hypothesize 
      that reporting of comorbidities by computer algorithms identifies more
      comorbidities than physician completion, and, therefore, is more reflective of
      underlying disease burden. METHODS: We collected data from CMS-2728 forms for all
      296 patients who had incident ESRD diagnosis and received chronic dialysis from
      2005 through 2014 at Indiana University outpatient dialysis centers. We analyzed 
      patients' data from electronic medical records systems that collated information 
      from multiple health care sources. Previously utilized algorithms or natural
      language processing was used to extract data on 10 comorbidities for a period of 
      up to 10 years prior to ESRD incidence. These algorithms incorporate billing
      codes, prescriptions, and other relevant elements. We compared the presence or
      unchecked status of these comorbidities on the forms to the presence or absence
      according to the algorithms. FINDINGS: Computer algorithms had higher reporting
      of comorbidities compared to forms completion by physicians. This remained true
      when decreasing data span to one year and using only a single health center
      source. The algorithms determination was well accepted by a physician panel.
      Importantly, algorithms use significantly increased the expected deaths and
      lowered the standardized mortality ratios. DISCUSSION: Using computer algorithms 
      showed superior identification of comorbidities for form CMS-2728 and altered
      standardized mortality ratios. Adapting similar algorithms in available EMR
      systems may offer more thorough evaluation of comorbidities and improve quality
      reporting.

TI  - Finding 'Evidence of Absence' in Medical Notes: Using NLP for Clinical
      Inferencing.
PG  - 79-82
AB  - Extracting evidence of the absence of a target of interest from medical text can 
      be useful in clinical inferencing. The purpose of our study was to develop a
      natural language processing (NLP) pipelineto identify the presence of indwelling 
      urinary catheters from electronic medical notes to aid in detection of
      catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). Finding clear evidence that
      a patient does not have an indwelling urinary catheter is useful in making a
      determination regarding CAUTI. We developed a lexicon of seven core concepts to
      infer the absence of a urinary catheter. Of the 990,391 concepts extractedby NLP 
      from a large corpus of 744,285 electronic medical notes from 5589 hospitalized
      patients, 63,516 were labeled as evidence of absence.Human review revealed three 
      primary causes for false negatives. The lexicon and NLP pipeline were refined
      using this information, resulting in outputs with an acceptable false positive
      rate of 11%.

TI  - Defining a Patient Population With Cirrhosis: An Automated Algorithm With Natural
      Language Processing.
PG  - 889-894
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to use natural language processing
      (NLP) as a supplement to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
      (ICD-9) and laboratory values in an automated algorithm to better define and
      risk-stratify patients with cirrhosis. BACKGROUND: Identification of patients
      with cirrhosis by manual data collection is time-intensive and laborious, whereas
      using ICD-9 codes can be inaccurate. NLP, a novel computerized approach to
      analyzing electronic free text, has been used to automatically identify patient
      cohorts with gastrointestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease.
      This methodology has not yet been used in cirrhosis. STUDY DESIGN: This
      retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University of California, Los
      Angeles Health, an academic medical center. A total of 5343 University of
      California, Los Angeles primary care patients with ICD-9 codes for chronic liver 
      disease were identified during March 2013 to January 2015. An algorithm
      incorporating NLP of radiology reports, ICD-9 codes, and laboratory data
      determined whether these patients had cirrhosis. Of the 5343 patients, 168
      patient charts were manually reviewed at random as a gold standard comparison.
      Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity,
      and specificity of the algorithm and each of its steps were calculated. RESULTS: 
      The algorithm's PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity were 91.78%, 96.84%,
      95.71%, and 93.88%, respectively. The NLP portion was the most important
      component of the algorithm with PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.44%,
      93.27%, 90.00%, and 98.98%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NLP is a powerful tool
      that can be combined with administrative and laboratory data to identify patients
      with cirrhosis within a population.

TI  - Dense Annotation of Free-Text Critical Care Discharge Summaries from an Indian
      Hospital and Associated Performance of a Clinical NLP Annotator.
PG  - 187
LID - 10.1007/s10916-016-0541-2 [doi]
AB  - Electronic Health Record (EHR) use in India is generally poor, and structured
      clinical information is mostly lacking. This work is the first attempt aimed at
      evaluating unstructured text mining for extracting relevant clinical information 
      from Indian clinical records. We annotated a corpus of 250 discharge summaries
      from an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in India, with markups for diseases,
      procedures, and lab parameters, their attributes, as well as key demographic
      information and administrative variables such as patient outcomes. In this
      process, we have constructed guidelines for an annotation scheme useful to
      clinicians in the Indian context. We evaluated the performance of an NLP engine, 
      Cocoa, on a cohort of these Indian clinical records. We have produced an
      annotated corpus of roughly 90 thousand words, which to our knowledge is the
      first tagged clinical corpus from India. Cocoa was evaluated on a test corpus of 
      50 documents. The overlap F-scores across the major categories, namely
      disease/symptoms, procedures, laboratory parameters and outcomes, are 0.856,
      0.834, 0.961 and 0.872 respectively. These results are competitive with results
      from recent shared tasks based on US records. The annotated corpus and associated
      results from the Cocoa engine indicate that unstructured text mining is a viable 
      method for cohort analysis in the Indian clinical context, where structured EHR
      records are largely absent.

TI  - Knowledge Author: facilitating user-driven, domain content development to support
      clinical information extraction.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s13326-016-0086-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems require a semantic
      schema comprised of domain-specific concepts, their lexical variants, and
      associated modifiers to accurately extract information from clinical texts. An
      NLP system leverages this schema to structure concepts and extract meaning from
      the free texts. In the clinical domain, creating a semantic schema typically
      requires input from both a domain expert, such as a clinician, and an NLP expert 
      who will represent clinical concepts created from the clinician's domain
      expertise into a computable format usable by an NLP system. The goal of this work
      is to develop a web-based tool, Knowledge Author, that bridges the gap between
      the clinical domain expert and the NLP system development by facilitating the
      development of domain content represented in a semantic schema for extracting
      information from clinical free-text. RESULTS: Knowledge Author is a web-based,
      recommendation system that supports users in developing domain content necessary 
      for clinical NLP applications. Knowledge Author's schematic model leverages a set
      of semantic types derived from the Secondary Use Clinical Element Models and the 
      Common Type System to allow the user to quickly create and modify domain-related 
      concepts. Features such as collaborative development and providing domain content
      suggestions through the mapping of concepts to the Unified Medical Language
      System Metathesaurus database further supports the domain content creation
      process. Two proof of concept studies were performed to evaluate the system's
      performance. The first study evaluated Knowledge Author's flexibility to create a
      broad range of concepts. A dataset of 115 concepts was created of which 87 (76 %)
      were able to be created using Knowledge Author. The second study evaluated the
      effectiveness of Knowledge Author's output in an NLP system by extracting
      concepts and associated modifiers representing a clinical element, carotid
      stenosis, from 34 clinical free-text radiology reports using Knowledge Author and
      an NLP system, pyConText. Knowledge Author's domain content produced high recall 
      for concepts (targeted findings: 86 %) and varied recall for modifiers
      (certainty: 91 % sidedness: 80 %, neurovascular anatomy: 46 %). CONCLUSION:
      Knowledge Author can support clinical domain content development for information 
      extraction by supporting semantic schema creation by domain experts.

TI  - Natural Language Processing to Assess Documentation of Features of Critical
      Illness in Discharge Documents of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Survivors.
PG  - 1538-45
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201602-131OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Transitions to outpatient care are crucial after critical illness, but
      the documentation practices in discharge documents after critical illness are
      unknown. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the rates of documentation of various
      features of critical illness in discharge documents of patients diagnosed with
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during their hospital stay. METHODS:
      We used natural language processing tools to build a keyword-based classifier
      that categorizes discharge documents by presence of terms from four groups of
      keywords related to critical illness. We used a multivariable modified Poisson
      regression model to infer patient- and hospital-level characteristics associated 
      with documentation of relevant keywords. A manual chart review was used to
      validate the accuracy of the keyword-based classifier, and to assess for ARDS
      documentation during the hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 815
      discharge documents, ARDS was identified in only 111 (13%). Mechanical
      ventilation was identified in 770 (92%) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission
      in 693 (83%) of discharge documents. Symptoms or recommendations related to
      post-intensive care syndrome were included in 306 (38%) of discharge documents.
      Patient age (older; relative risk [RR] = 0.97/yr, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
      0.96-0.98) and higher PaO2:FiO2 (decreasing illness severity; RR = 0.96/10-unit
      increment, 95% CI = 0.93-0.98) were associated with decreased documentation of
      ARDS. Being discharged from a surgical (RR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.22-0.50) compared
      with a medicine service was also associated with decreased rates of ARDS
      documentation. The manual chart review revealed 98% concordance between ARDS
      documentation in the discharge summary and during the hospital stay. Accuracy of 
      the document classifier was 100% for ARDS and mechanical ventilation, 98% for ICU
      admission, and 95% for symptoms of post-intensive care syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      the discharge documents of survivors of ARDS, ARDS itself is rarely mentioned,
      but mechanical ventilation and ICU stay frequently are. The low rates of
      documentation of ARDS appear to be concordant with low rates of documentation
      during the hospital stay, consistent with known underrecognition in the ICU.
      Natural language processing tools can be used to effectively analyze large
      numbers of discharge documents of patients with critical illness.

TI  - Mining Clinicians' Electronic Documentation to Identify Heart Failure Patients
      with Ineffective Self-Management: A Pilot Text-Mining Study.
PG  - 856-7
AB  - Effective self-management can decrease up to 50% of heart failure
      hospitalizations. Unfortunately, self-management by patients with heart failure
      remains poor. This pilot study aimed to explore the use of text-mining to
      identify heart failure patients with ineffective self-management. We first built 
      a comprehensive self-management vocabulary based on the literature and clinical
      notes review. We then randomly selected 545 heart failure patients treated within
      Partners Healthcare hospitals (Boston, MA, USA) and conducted a regular
      expression search with the compiled vocabulary within 43,107 interdisciplinary
      clinical notes of these patients. We found that 38.2% (n = 208) patients had
      documentation of ineffective heart failure self-management in the domains of poor
      diet adherence (28.4%), missed medical encounters (26.4%) poor medication
      adherence (20.2%) and non-specified self-management issues (e.g., "compliance
      issues", 34.6%). We showed the feasibility of using text-mining to identify
      patients with ineffective self-management. More natural language processing
      algorithms are needed to help busy clinicians identify these patients.

      include incident reporting and medical records review. Because of limitations of 
      each method, researchers suggest multimodal approaches. Although incident
      reporting is commonly used, medical records review is limited by the need to read
      a high volume of clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) is 1 potential
      mechanism to automate this process. METHOD: We compared automated NLP to manual
      chart review and incident reporting as a method to detect falls among inpatients.
      First, we developed an NLP algorithm to identify inpatient progress notes
      describing falls. Second, we compared the NLP algorithm to manual records review 
      in identifying inpatient progress notes that describe falls. Third, we compared
      the NLP algorithm to the incident reporting system in identifying falls. RESULTS:
      When examining individual inpatient notes, our NLP algorithm was highly specific 
      (0.97) but had low sensitivity (0.44) when compared with our manual records
      review. However, when considering groups of inpatient notes, all describing the
      same fall, our NLP algorithm had a large improvement in sensitivity (0.80) with
      some loss of specificity (0.65) compared with incident reporting. CONCLUSIONS:
      National language processing represents a promising method to automate review of 
      inpatient medical records to identify falls.

TI  - Nesfatin-1-Like Peptide Encoded in Nucleobindin-1 in Goldfish is a Novel
      Anorexigen Modulated by Sex Steroids, Macronutrients and Daily Rhythm.
PG  - 28377

AB  - Nesfatin-1 is an 82 amino acid anorexigen encoded in a secreted precursor
      nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2). NUCB2 was named so due to its high sequence similarity
      with nucleobindin-1 (NUCB1). It was recently reported that NUCB1 encodes an
      insulinotropic nesfatin-1-like peptide (NLP) in mice. Here, we aimed to
      characterize NLP in fish. RT- qPCR showed NUCB1 expression in both central and
      peripheral tissues. Western blot analysis and/or fluorescence
      immunohistochemistry determined NUCB1/NLP in the brain, pituitary, testis, ovary 
      and gut of goldfish. NUCB1 mRNA expression in goldfish pituitary and gut
      displayed a daily rhythmic pattern of expression. Pituitary NUCB1 mRNA expression
      was downregulated by estradiol, while testosterone upregulated its expression in 
      female goldfish brain. High carbohydrate and fat suppressed NUCB1 mRNA expression
      in the brain and gut. Intraperitoneal injection of synthetic rat NLP and goldfish
      NLP at 10 and 100 ng/g body weight doses caused potent inhibition of food intake 
      in goldfish. NLP injection also downregulated the expression of mRNAs encoding
      orexigens, preproghrelin and orexin-A, and upregulated anorexigen cocaine and
      amphetamine regulated transcript mRNA in goldfish brain. Collectively, these
      results provide the first set of results supporting the anorectic action of NLP, 
      and the regulation of tissue specific expression of goldfish NUCB1.

TI  - A new algorithmic approach for the extraction of temporal associations from
      clinical narratives with an application to medical product safety surveillance
      reports.

AB  - The sheer volume of textual information that needs to be reviewed and analyzed in
      many clinical settings requires the automated retrieval of key clinical and
      temporal information. The existing natural language processing systems are often 
      challenged by the low quality of clinical texts and do not demonstrate the
      required performance. In this study, we focus on medical product safety report
      narratives and investigate the association of the clinical events with
      appropriate time information. We developed a novel algorithm for tagging and
      extracting temporal information from the narratives, and associating it with
      related events. The proposed algorithm minimizes the performance dependency on
      text quality by relying only on shallow syntactic information and primitive
      properties of the extracted event and time entities. We demonstrated the
      effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by evaluating its tagging and time
      assignment capabilities on 140 randomly selected reports from the US Vaccine
      Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration)
      Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). We compared the performance of our tagger
      with the SUTime and HeidelTime taggers, and our algorithm's event-time
      associations with the Temporal Awareness and Reasoning Systems for Question
      Interpretation (TARSQI). We further evaluated the ability of our algorithm to
      correctly identify the time information for the events in the 2012 Informatics
      for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) Challenge corpus. For the time
      tagging task, our algorithm performed better than the SUTime and the HeidelTime
      taggers (F-measure in VAERS and FAERS: Our algorithm: 0.86 and 0.88, SUTime: 0.77
      and 0.74, and HeidelTime 0.75 and 0.42, respectively). In the event-time
      association task, our algorithm assigned an inappropriate timestamp for 25% of
      the events, while the TARSQI toolkit demonstrated a considerably lower
      performance, assigning inappropriate timestamps in 61.5% of the same events. Our 
      algorithm also supported the correct calculation of 69% of the event relations to
      the section time in the i2b2 testing set.

TI  - Using Social Media Data to Identify Potential Candidates for Drug Repurposing: A 
      Feasibility Study.
PG  - e121
LID - 10.2196/resprot.5621 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug repurposing (defined as discovering new indications for existing
      drugs) could play a significant role in drug development, especially considering 
      the declining success rates of developing novel drugs. Typically, new indications
      for existing medications are identified by accident. However, new technologies
      and a large number of available resources enable the development of systematic
      approaches to identify and validate drug-repurposing candidates. Patients today
      report their experiences with medications on social media and reveal side effects
      as well as beneficial effects of those medications. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to
      assess the feasibility of using patient reviews from social media to identify
      potential candidates for drug repurposing. METHODS: We retrieved patient reviews 
      of 180 medications from an online forum, WebMD. Using dictionary-based and
      machine learning approaches, we identified disease names in the reviews. Several 
      publicly available resources were used to exclude comments containing known
      indications and adverse drug effects. After manually reviewing some of the
      remaining comments, we implemented a rule-based system to identify beneficial
      effects. RESULTS: The dictionary-based system and machine learning system
      identified 2178 and 6171 disease names respectively in 64,616 patient comments.
      We provided a list of 10 common patterns that patients used to report any
      beneficial effects or uses of medication. After manually reviewing the comments
      tagged by our rule-based system, we identified five potential drug repurposing
      candidates. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to consider
      using social media data to identify drug-repurposing candidates. We found that
      even a rule-based system, with a limited number of rules, could identify
      beneficial effect mentions in patient comments. Our preliminary study shows that 
      social media has the potential to be used in drug repurposing.

TI  - Optic nerve avulsion after blunt ocular trauma - Case report.
PG  - 382-3
LID - 10.5604/12321966.1203911 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Avulsion of the optic nerve head is a rare and severe complication 
      of ocular blunt trauma. The case reported is a 28-year old man presenting to the 
      emergency department due to blunt trauma to his right eye globe with a tree
      branch. Lid haematoma and subconjunctival haemorrhage were present. Visual acuity
      soon after the injury was counting fingers (CF) and on admission to the
      Department of Ophthalmology he had no light perception (NLP). Fundus examination 
      revealed prepapillary haemorrhage, which after few days dispersed into the
      vitreous cavity. Despite no light perception in the affected eye, the patient was
      qualified for vitrectomy. During surgery, an optic nerve avulsion with
      cicatricial gliosis was diagnosed. Six months after vitrectomy, the visual acuity
      was NLP in the right eye. DISCUSSION: The clinical signs, mechanism, treatment
      and natural history of this poorly known disease are described. CONCLUSION: Optic
      nerve avulsion must be considered in cases of trauma with forced rotation of the 
      eye. Damage occurring at the disc may suggest mechanisms involving anterior
      luxation of the globe, retropulsion of the nerve, forced globe rotation, or a
      sudden explosive rise in intraocular pressure blowing the nerve off the sclera
      into its dural sheath. Damage and break of the nerve fibres are responsible for
      immediate visual impairments, and involving secondary haematomas and oedemas In
      spite of required safety precautions in agriculture work, eye injuries are still 
      prevalent. Blunt ocular trauma remains a large part of this group, leading even
      to irreversible blindness.

TI  - Rapidly Mixing Gibbs Sampling for a Class of Factor Graphs Using Hierarchy Width.
PG  - 3079-3087
AB  - Gibbs sampling on factor graphs is a widely used inference technique, which often
      produces good empirical results. Theoretical guarantees for its performance are
      weak: even for tree structured graphs, the mixing time of Gibbs may be
      exponential in the number of variables. To help understand the behavior of Gibbs 
      sampling, we introduce a new (hyper)graph property, called hierarchy width. We
      show that under suitable conditions on the weights, bounded hierarchy width
      ensures polynomial mixing time. Our study of hierarchy width is in part motivated
      by a class of factor graph templates, hierarchical templates, which have bounded 
      hierarchy width-regardless of the data used to instantiate them. We demonstrate a
      rich application from natural language processing in which Gibbs sampling
      provably mixes rapidly and achieves accuracy that exceeds human volunteers.

TI  - Extracting and analyzing ejection fraction values from electronic
      echocardiography reports in a large health maintenance organization.
LID - 1460458216651917 [pii]
AB  - The left ventricular ejection fraction value is an important prognostic indicator
      of cardiovascular outcomes including morbidity and mortality and is often used
      clinically to indicate severity of heart disease. However, it is usually reported
      in free-text echocardiography reports. We developed and validated a computerized 
      algorithm to extract ejection fraction values from echocardiography reports and
      applied the algorithm to a large volume of unstructured echocardiography reports 
      between 1995 and 2011 in a large health maintenance organization. A total of
      621,856 echocardiography reports with a description of ejection fraction values
      or systolic functions were identified, of which 70 percent contained numeric
      ejection fraction values and the rest (30%) were text descriptions explicitly
      indicating the systolic left ventricular function. The 12.1 percent (16.0% for
      male and 8.4% for female) of these extracted ejection fraction values are <45
      percent. Validation conducted based on a random sample of 200 reports yielded
      95.0 percent sensitivity and 96.9 percent positive predictive value.

TI  - Temporal bone radiology report classification using open source machine learning 
      and natural langue processing libraries.
PG  - 65
LID - 10.1186/s12911-016-0306-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiology reports are a rich resource for biomedical research. Prior 
      to utilization, trained experts must manually review reports to identify discrete
      outcomes. The Audiological and Genetic Database (AudGenDB) is a public,
      de-identified research database that contains over 16,000 radiology reports.
      Because the reports are unlabeled, it is difficult to select those with specific 
      abnormalities. We implemented a classification pipeline using a human-in-the-loop
      machine learning approach and open source libraries to label the reports with one
      or more of four abnormality region labels: inner, middle, outer, and mastoid,
      indicating the presence of an abnormality in the specified ear region. METHODS:
      Trained abstractors labeled radiology reports taken from AudGenDB to form a gold 
      standard. These were split into training (80 %) and test (20 %) sets. We applied 
      open source libraries to normalize and convert every report to an n-gram feature 
      vector. We trained logistic regression, support vector machine (linear and
      Gaussian), decision tree, random forest, and naive Bayes models for each ear
      region. The models were evaluated on the hold-out test set. RESULTS: Our
      gold-standard data set contained 726 reports. The best classifiers were linear
      support vector machine for inner and outer ear, logistic regression for middle
      ear, and decision tree for mastoid. Classifier test set accuracy was 90 %, 90 %, 
      93 %, and 82 % for the inner, middle, outer and mastoid regions, respectively.
      The logistic regression method was very consistent, achieving accuracy scores
      within 2.75 % of the best classifier across regions and a receiver operator
      characteristic area under the curve of 0.92 or greater across all regions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the applied methods achieve accuracy
      scores sufficient to support our objective of extracting discrete features from
      radiology reports to enhance cohort identification in AudGenDB. The models
      described here are available in several free, open source libraries that make
      them more accessible and simplify their utilization as demonstrated in this work.
      We additionally implemented the models as a web service that accepts radiology
      report text in an HTTP request and provides the predicted region labels. This
      service has been used to label the reports in AudGenDB and is freely available.

TI  - A corpus of potentially contradictory research claims from cardiovascular
      research abstracts.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1186/s13326-016-0083-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research literature in biomedicine and related fields contains a huge
      number of claims, such as the effectiveness of treatments. These claims are not
      always consistent and may even contradict each other. Being able to identify
      contradictory claims is important for those who rely on the biomedical
      literature. Automated methods to identify and resolve them are required to cope
      with the amount of information available. However, research in this area has been
      hampered by a lack of suitable resources. We describe a methodology to develop a 
      corpus which addresses this gap by providing examples of potentially
      contradictory claims and demonstrate how it can be applied to identify these
      claims from Medline abstracts related to the topic of cardiovascular disease.
      METHODS: A set of systematic reviews concerned with four topics in cardiovascular
      disease were identified from Medline and analysed to determine whether the
      abstracts they reviewed contained contradictory research claims. For each review,
      annotators were asked to analyse these abstracts to identify claims within them
      that answered the question addressed in the review. The annotators were also
      asked to indicate how the claim related to that question and the type of the
      claim. RESULTS: A total of 259 abstracts associated with 24 systematic reviews
      were used to form the corpus. Agreement between the annotators was high,
      suggesting that the information they provided is reliable. CONCLUSIONS: The paper
      describes a methodology for constructing a corpus containing contradictory
      research claims from the biomedical literature. The corpus is made available to
      enable further research into this area and support the development of automated
      approaches to contradiction identification.

TI  - Transoral laser microsurgery for managing laryngeal stenosis after reconstructive
      partial laryngectomies.
PG  - 359-365
LID - 10.1002/lary.26056 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To retrospectively analyze our experience of transoral
      laser microsurgery (TLM) for treating postoperative laryngeal obstruction (POLO) 
      after supracricoid and supratracheal laryngectomy (open partial horizontal
      laryngectomy [OPHL]) types 2 and 3, and to investigate potential relationships
      between patients' clinical features and their functional outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: 
      A retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The prognostic influence of clinical and
      surgical parameters on functional outcomes was investigated in a univariate
      statistical setting in terms of decannulation rate (DR), time to tracheostomy
      closure (TTC), and number of laser procedures required (NLP). RESULTS: OPHL type 
      2 was associated with a better functional outcome than OPHL type 3 in terms of
      DR, TTC, and NLP (P = .03, P = .02, and P = .02, respectively). Annular and
      semicircumferential stenoses developed more frequently after OPHL type 3, and
      were particularly difficult to manage with TLM. Fixation of the residual
      arytenoid was a negative prognostic factor in terms of functional outcome in
      terms of DR, TTC, and NLP (P = .0002, P = .08, and P = .08, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: There is no standardized laser treatment for POLO; it must be
      tailored to individual patients. Identifying prognostic factors influencing
      functional outcome could help surgeons to earmark patients less likely to benefit
      from TLM for the treatment of POLO, and enable an adequate preoperative
      counseling, given the high probability of repeat postoperative TLM procedures.

TI  - Methodological Issues in Predicting Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Candidates Through
      Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
PG  - 11-8
LID - 10.4137/BII.S38308 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe the development and evaluation of a system that uses
      machine learning and natural language processing techniques to identify potential
      candidates for surgical intervention for drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy. The
      data are comprised of free-text clinical notes extracted from the electronic
      health record (EHR). Both known clinical outcomes from the EHR and manual chart
      annotations provide gold standards for the patient's status. The following
      hypotheses are then tested: 1) machine learning methods can identify epilepsy
      surgery candidates as well as physicians do and 2) machine learning methods can
      identify candidates earlier than physicians do. These hypotheses are tested by
      systematically evaluating the effects of the data source, amount of training
      data, class balance, classification algorithm, and feature set on classifier
      performance. The results support both hypotheses, with F-measures ranging from
      0.71 to 0.82. The feature set, classification algorithm, amount of training data,
      class balance, and gold standard all significantly affected classification
      performance. It was further observed that classification performance was better
      than the highest agreement between two annotators, even at one year before
      documented surgery referral. The results demonstrate that such machine learning
      methods can contribute to predicting pediatric epilepsy surgery candidates and
      reducing lag time to surgery referral.

TI  - Extrapolating human judgments from skip-gram vector representations of word
      meaning.
PG  - 1603-1619
LID - 10.1080/17470218.2016.1195417 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing body of research in psychology that attempts to extrapolate
      human lexical judgments from computational models of semantics. This research can
      be used to help develop comprehensive norm sets for experimental research, it has
      applications to large-scale statistical modelling of lexical access and has broad
      value within natural language processing and sentiment analysis. However, the
      value of extrapolated human judgments has recently been questioned within
      psychological research. Of primary concern is the fact that extrapolated
      judgments may not share the same pattern of statistical relationship with lexical
      and semantic variables as do actual human judgments; often the error component in
      extrapolated judgments is not psychologically inert, making such judgments
      problematic to use for psychological research. We present a new methodology for
      extrapolating human judgments that partially addresses prior concerns of
      validity. We use this methodology to extrapolate human judgments of valence,
      arousal, dominance, and concreteness for 78,286 words. We also provide resources 
      for users to extrapolate these human judgments for three million English words
      and short phrases. Applications for large sets of extrapolated human judgments
      are demonstrated and discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the utility of novel
      verbal fluency scores for predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) to clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: Verbal fluency lists
      (animals, vegetables, F, A, and S) from 107 MCI patients and 51 cognitively
      normal controls were transcribed into electronic text files and automatically
      scored with traditional raw scores and five types of novel scores computed using 
      methods from machine learning and natural language processing. Additional scores 
      were derived from structural MRI scans: region of interest measures of
      hippocampal and ventricular volumes and gray matter scores derived from
      performing ICA on measures of cortical thickness. Over 4 years of follow-up, 24
      MCI patients converted to AD. Using conversion as the outcome variable, ensemble 
      classifiers were constructed by training classifiers on the individual groups of 
      scores and then entering predictions from the primary classifiers into
      regularized logistic regression models. Receiver operating characteristic curves 
      were plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was measured for classifiers
      trained with five groups of available variables. RESULTS: Classifiers trained
      with novel scores outperformed those trained with raw scores (AUC 0.872 vs 0.735;
      P < .05 by DeLong test). Addition of structural brain measurements did not
      improve performance based on novel scores alone. CONCLUSION: The brevity and cost
      profile of verbal fluency tasks recommends their use for clinical decision
      making. The word lists generated are a rich source of information for predicting 
      outcomes in MCI. Further work is needed to assess the utility of verbal fluency
      for early AD.

TI  - Machine Translation of Public Health Materials From English to Chinese: A
      Feasibility Study.
PG  - e17
LID - 10.2196/publichealth.4779 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chinese is the second most common language spoken by limited English 
      proficiency individuals in the United States, yet there are few public health
      materials available in Chinese. Previous studies have indicated that use of
      machine translation plus postediting by bilingual translators generated quality
      translations in a lower time and at a lower cost than human translations.
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using 
      machine translation (MT) tools (eg, Google Translate) followed by human
      postediting (PE) to produce quality Chinese translations of public health
      materials. METHODS: From state and national public health websites, we collected 
      60 health promotion documents that had been translated from English to Chinese
      through human translation. The English version of the documents were then
      translated to Chinese using Google Translate. The MTs were analyzed for
      translation errors. A subset of the MT documents was postedited by native Chinese
      speakers with health backgrounds. Postediting time was measured. Postedited
      versions were then blindly compared against human translations by bilingual
      native Chinese quality raters. RESULTS: The most common machine translation
      errors were errors of word sense (40%) and word order (22%). Posteditors
      corrected the MTs at a rate of approximately 41 characters per minute. Raters,
      blinded to the source of translation, consistently selected the human translation
      over the MT+PE. Initial investigation to determine the reasons for the lower
      quality of MT+PE indicate that poor MT quality, lack of posteditor expertise, and
      insufficient posteditor instructions can be barriers to producing quality Chinese
      translations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed problems with using MT tools plus
      human postediting for translating public health materials from English to
      Chinese. Additional work is needed to improve MT and to carefully design
      postediting processes before the MT+PE approach can be used routinely in public
      health practice for a variety of language pairs.

      strategy in Caenorhabditis elegans.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.14116 [doi]
LID - e14116 [pii]
AB  - In animal locomotion a tradeoff exists between stereotypy and flexibility: fast
      long-distance travelling (LDT) requires coherent regular motions, while local
      sampling and area-restricted search (ARS) rely on flexible movements. We report
      here on a posture control system in C. elegans that coordinates these needs.
      Using quantitative posture analysis we explain worm locomotion as a composite of 
      two modes: regular undulations versus flexible turning. Graded reciprocal
      regulation of both modes allows animals to flexibly adapt their locomotion
      strategy under sensory stimulation along a spectrum ranging from LDT to ARS.
      Using genetics and functional imaging of neural activity we characterize the
      counteracting interneurons AVK and DVA that utilize FLP-1 and NLP-12
      neuropeptides to control both motor modes. Gradual regulation of behaviors via
      this system is required for spatial navigation during chemotaxis. This work shows
      how a nervous system controls simple elementary features of posture to generate
      complex movements for goal-directed locomotion strategies.

TI  - miRiaD: A Text Mining Tool for Detecting Associations of microRNAs with Diseases.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/s13326-015-0044-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are increasingly being appreciated as critical players in
      human diseases, and questions concerning the role of microRNAs arise in many
      areas of biomedical research. There are several manually curated databases of
      microRNA-disease associations gathered from the biomedical literature; however,
      it is difficult for curators of these databases to keep up with the explosion of 
      publications in the microRNA-disease field. Moreover, automated literature mining
      tools that assist manual curation of microRNA-disease associations currently
      capture only one microRNA property (expression) in the context of one disease
      (cancer). Thus, there is a clear need to develop more sophisticated automated
      literature mining tools that capture a variety of microRNA properties and
      relations in the context of multiple diseases to provide researchers with fast
      access to the most recent published information and to streamline and accelerate 
      manual curation. METHODS: We have developed miRiaD (microRNAs in association with
      Disease), a text-mining tool that automatically extracts associations between
      microRNAs and diseases from the literature. These associations are often not
      directly linked, and the intermediate relations are often highly informative for 
      the biomedical researcher. Thus, miRiaD extracts the miR-disease pairs together
      with an explanation for their association. We also developed a procedure that
      assigns scores to sentences, marking their informativeness, based on the
      microRNA-disease relation observed within the sentence. RESULTS: miRiaD was
      applied to the entire Medline corpus, identifying 8301 PMIDs with miR-disease
      associations. These abstracts and the miR-disease associations are available for 
      browsing at http://biotm.cis.udel.edu/miRiaD . We evaluated the recall and
      precision of miRiaD with respect to information of high interest to public
      microRNA-disease database curators (expression and target gene associations),
      obtaining a recall of 88.46-90.78. When we expanded the evaluation to include
      sentences with a wide range of microRNA-disease information that may be of
      interest to biomedical researchers, miRiaD also performed very well with a
      F-score of 89.4. The informativeness ranking of sentences was evaluated in terms 
      of nDCG (0.977) and correlation metrics (0.678-0.727) when compared to an
      annotator's ranked list. CONCLUSIONS: miRiaD, a high performance system that can 
      capture a wide variety of microRNA-disease related information, extends beyond
      the scope of existing microRNA-disease resources. It can be incorporated into
      manual curation pipelines and serve as a resource for biomedical researchers
      interested in the role of microRNAs in disease. In our ongoing work we are
      developing an improved miRiaD web interface that will facilitate complex queries 
      about microRNA-disease relationships, such as "In what diseases does microRNA
      regulation of apoptosis play a role?" or "Is there overlap in the sets of genes
      targeted by microRNAs in different types of dementia?"."

TI  - Opiates Modulate Noxious Chemical Nociception through a Complex
      Monoaminergic/Peptidergic Cascade.
PG  - 5498-508
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4520-15.2016 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The ability to detect noxious stimuli, process the nociceptive
      signal, and elicit an appropriate behavioral response is essential for survival. 
      In Caenorhabditis elegans, opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine, mimic
      serotonin, and suppress the overall withdrawal from noxious stimuli through a
      pathway requiring the opioid-like receptor, NPR-17. This serotonin- or
      morphine-dependent modulation can be rescued in npr-17-null animals by the
      expression of npr-17 or a human kappa opioid receptor in the two ASI sensory
      neurons, with ASI opioid signaling selectively inhibiting ASI neuropeptide
      release. Serotonergic modulation requires peptides encoded by both nlp-3 and
      nlp-24, and either nlp-3 or nlp-24 overexpression mimics morphine and suppresses 
      withdrawal. Peptides encoded by nlp-3 act differentially, with only NLP-3.3
      mimicking morphine, whereas other nlp-3 peptides antagonize NLP-3.3 modulation.
      Together, these results demonstrate that opiates modulate nociception in
      Caenorhabditis elegans through a complex monoaminergic/peptidergic cascade, and
      suggest that this model may be useful for dissecting opiate signaling in mammals.
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Opiates are used extensively to treat chronic pain. In
      Caenorhabditis elegans, opioid receptor agonists suppress the overall withdrawal 
      from noxious chemical stimuli through a pathway requiring an opioid-like receptor
      and two distinct neuropeptide-encoding genes, with individual peptides from the
      same gene functioning antagonistically to modulate nociception. Endogenous opioid
      signaling functions as part of a complex, monoaminergic/peptidergic signaling
      cascade and appears to selectively inhibit neuropeptide release, mediated by a
      alpha-adrenergic-like receptor, from two sensory neurons. Importantly, receptor
      null animals can be rescued by the expression of the human kappa opioid receptor,
      and injection of human opioid receptor ligands mimics exogenous opiates,
      highlighting the utility of this model for dissecting opiate signaling in
      mammals.

TI  - Comparative study on the customization of natural language interfaces to
      databases.
PG  - 553
LID - 10.1186/s40064-016-2164-y [doi]
AB  - In the last decades the popularity of natural language interfaces to databases
      (NLIDBs) has increased, because in many cases information obtained from them is
      used for making important business decisions. Unfortunately, the complexity of
      their customization by database administrators make them difficult to use. In
      order for a NLIDB to obtain a high percentage of correctly translated queries, it
      is necessary that it is correctly customized for the database to be queried. In
      most cases the performance reported in NLIDB literature is the highest possible; 
      i.e., the performance obtained when the interfaces were customized by the
      implementers. However, for end users it is more important the performance that
      the interface can yield when the NLIDB is customized by someone different from
      the implementers. Unfortunately, there exist very few articles that report NLIDB 
      performance when the NLIDBs are not customized by the implementers. This article 
      presents a semantically-enriched data dictionary (which permits solving many of
      the problems that occur when translating from natural language to SQL) and an
      experiment in which two groups of undergraduate students customized our NLIDB and
      English language frontend (ELF), considered one of the best available commercial 
      NLIDBs. The experimental results show that, when customized by the first group,
      our NLIDB obtained a 44.69 % of correctly answered queries and ELF 11.83 % for
      the ATIS database, and when customized by the second group, our NLIDB attained
      77.05 % and ELF 13.48 %. The performance attained by our NLIDB, when customized
      by ourselves was 90 %.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular risk of patients with alopecia areata (AA) is not 
      well characterized, with limited studies evaluating the risk of acute myocardial 
      infarction (AMI) and ischemic stroke. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the risk 
      for patients with AA to develop subsequent stroke and AMI. METHODS: We conducted 
      propensity-matched retrospective analysis between January 1, 2000, and January 1,
      2010, from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in
      Boston, MA. A comprehensive research patient data repository search was done for 
      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 704.01 and cases
      were verified using a natural language processing program. Propensity score
      matching was used to identify controls for AA cases based on age, race, gender,
      smoking status, and history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.
      RESULTS: We identified 1377 cases of AA matched with 4131 controls. Patients with
      AA had decreased odds for developing stroke (odds ratio 0.39, 95% CI 0.18-0.87)
      and a trend toward decreased risk of AMI (odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.59-1.39).
      LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study using a clinical database.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with AA had decreased risk for stroke and AMI, although not 
      statistically significant. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings
      in other AA cohorts and to elucidate a potential mechanism.

TI  - Vocabulary Size in Speech May Be an Early Indicator of Cognitive Impairment.
PG  - e0155195
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0155195 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the relationship between mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      and changes to language abilities. Here, we used the revised Hasegawa Dementia
      Scale (HDS-R) to identify suspected MCI in elderly individuals. We then analyzed 
      written and spoken narratives to compare the language abilities between study
      participants with and without MCI in order to explore the relationship between
      cognitive and language abilities, and to identify a possible indicator for the
      early detection of MCI and dementia. We recruited 22 people aged 74 to 86 years
      (mean: 78.32 years; standard deviation: 3.36). The participants were requested to
      write and talk about one of the happiest events in their lives. Based on HDS-R
      scores, we divided the participants into 2 groups: the MCI Group comprised 8
      participants with a score of 26 or lower, while the Healthy Group comprised 14
      participants with a score of 27 or higher. The transcriptions of both written and
      spoken samples for each participant were used in the measurement of NLP-based
      language ability scores. Our analysis showed no significant differences in
      writing abilities between the 2 groups in any of the language ability scores.
      However, analysis of the spoken narrative showed that the MCI Group had a
      significantly larger vocabulary size. In addition, analysis of a metric that
      signified the gap in content between the spoken and written narratives also
      revealed a larger vocabulary size in the MCI Group. Individuals with early-stage 
      MCI may be engaging in behavior to conceal their deteriorating cognition, thereby
      leading to a temporary increase in their active spoken vocabulary. These results 
      indicate the possible detection of early stages of reduced cognition before
      dementia onset through the analysis of spoken narratives.

TI  - Extracting a stroke phenotype risk factor from Veteran Health Administration
      clinical reports: an information content analysis.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/s13326-016-0065-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the United States, 795,000 people suffer strokes each year; 10-15 
      % of these strokes can be attributed to stenosis caused by plaque in the carotid 
      artery, a major stroke phenotype risk factor. Studies comparing treatments for
      the management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis are challenging for at least two 
      reasons: 1) administrative billing codes (i.e., Current Procedural Terminology
      (CPT) codes) that identify carotid images do not denote which neurovascular
      arteries are affected and 2) the majority of the image reports are negative for
      carotid stenosis. Studies that rely on manual chart abstraction can be
      labor-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
      can expedite the process of manual chart abstraction by automatically filtering
      reports with no/insignificant carotid stenosis findings and flagging reports with
      significant carotid stenosis findings; thus, potentially reducing effort, costs, 
      and time. METHODS: In this pilot study, we conducted an information content
      analysis of carotid stenosis mentions in terms of their report location
      (Sections), report formats (structures) and linguistic descriptions (expressions)
      from Veteran Health Administration free-text reports. We assessed an NLP
      algorithm, pyConText's, ability to discern reports with significant carotid
      stenosis findings from reports with no/insignificant carotid stenosis findings
      given these three document composition factors for two report types: radiology
      (RAD) and text integration utility (TIU) notes. RESULTS: We observed that most
      carotid mentions are recorded in prose using categorical expressions, within the 
      Findings and Impression sections for RAD reports and within neither of these
      designated sections for TIU notes. For RAD reports, pyConText performed with high
      sensitivity (88 %), specificity (84 %), and negative predictive value (95 %) and 
      reasonable positive predictive value (70 %). For TIU notes, pyConText performed
      with high specificity (87 %) and negative predictive value (92 %), reasonable
      sensitivity (73 %), and moderate positive predictive value (58 %). pyConText
      performed with the highest sensitivity processing the full report rather than the
      Findings or Impressions independently. CONCLUSION: We conclude that pyConText can
      reduce chart review efforts by filtering reports with no/insignificant carotid
      stenosis findings and flagging reports with significant carotid stenosis findings
      from the Veteran Health Administration electronic health record, and hence has
      utility for expediting a comparative effectiveness study of treatment strategies 
      for stroke prevention.

AB  - Women with severe mental illness are at increased risk of suicide in the
      perinatal period, and these suicides are often preceded by self-harm, but little 
      is known about self-harm and its correlates in this population. This study aimed 
      to investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and self-harm, and its
      correlates, in women with psychotic disorders and bipolar disorder during
      pregnancy. Historical cohort study using de-identified secondary mental
      healthcare records linked with national maternity data. Women pregnant from 2007 
      to 2011, with ICD-10 diagnoses of schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar
      disorder or other affective psychoses were identified. Data were extracted from
      structured fields, natural language processing applications and free text.
      Logistic regression was used to examine the correlates of self-harm in pregnancy.
      Of 420 women, 103 (24.5 %) had a record of suicidal ideation during the first
      index pregnancy, with self-harm recorded in 33 (7.9 %). Self-harm was
      independently associated with younger age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.91, 95 %
      CI 0.85-0.98), self-harm in the previous 2 years (aOR 2.55; 1.05-6.50) and
      smoking (aOR 3.64; 1.30-10.19). A higher prevalence of self-harm was observed in 
      women with non-affective psychosis, those who discontinued or switched medication
      and in women on no medication at the start of pregnancy, but these findings were 
      not statistically significant in multivariable analyses. Suicidal thoughts and
      self-harm occur in a significant proportion of pregnant women with severe mental 
      illness, particularly younger women and those with a history of self-harm; these 
      women need particularly close monitoring for suicidality.

TI  - Integrating language models into classifiers for BCI communication: a review.
PG  - 031002
LID - 10.1088/1741-2560/13/3/031002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present review systematically examines the integration of language
      models to improve classifier performance in brain-computer interface (BCI)
      communication systems. APPROACH: The domain of natural language has been studied 
      extensively in linguistics and has been used in the natural language processing
      field in applications including information extraction, machine translation, and 
      speech recognition. While these methods have been used for years in traditional
      augmentative and assistive communication devices, information about the output
      domain has largely been ignored in BCI communication systems. Over the last few
      years, BCI communication systems have started to leverage this information
      through the inclusion of language models. MAIN RESULTS: Although this movement
      began only recently, studies have already shown the potential of language
      integration in BCI communication and it has become a growing field in BCI
      research. BCI communication systems using language models in their classifiers
      have progressed down several parallel paths, including: word completion; signal
      classification; integration of process models; dynamic stopping; unsupervised
      learning; error correction; and evaluation. SIGNIFICANCE: Each of these methods
      have shown significant progress, but have largely been addressed separately.
      Combining these methods could use the full potential of language model, yielding 
      further performance improvements. This integration should be a priority as the
      field works to create a BCI system that meets the needs of the amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis population.

TI  - Interactive use of online health resources: a comparison of consumer and
      professional questions.
PG  - 802-11
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocw024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand how consumer questions on online resources differ from
      questions asked by professionals, and how such consumer questions differ across
      resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten online question corpora, 5 consumer and 5
      professional, with a combined total of over 40 000 questions, were analyzed using
      a variety of natural language processing techniques. These techniques analyze
      questions at the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels, exposing differences in
      both form and content. RESULTS: Consumer questions tend to be longer than
      professional questions, more closely resemble open-domain language, and focus far
      more on medical problems. Consumers ask more sub-questions, provide far more
      background information, and ask different types of questions than professionals. 
      Furthermore, there is substantial variance of these factors between the different
      consumer corpora. DISCUSSION: The form of consumer questions is highly dependent 
      upon the individual online resource, especially in the amount of background
      information provided. Professionals, on the other hand, provide very little
      background information and often ask much shorter questions. The content of
      consumer questions is also highly dependent upon the resource. While professional
      questions commonly discuss treatments and tests, consumer questions focus
      disproportionately on symptoms and diseases. Further, consumers place far more
      emphasis on certain types of health problems (eg, sexual health). CONCLUSION:
      Websites for consumers to submit health questions are a popular online resource
      filling important gaps in consumer health information. By analyzing how consumers
      write questions on these resources, we can better understand these gaps and
      create solutions for improving information access.This article is part of the

TI  - Automatic Analysis of Critical Incident Reports: Requirements and Use Cases.
PG  - 85-92
AB  - Increasingly, critical incident reports are used as a means to increase patient
      safety and quality of care. The entire potential of these sources of experiential
      knowledge remains often unconsidered since retrieval and analysis is difficult
      and time-consuming, and the reporting systems often do not provide support for
      these tasks. The objective of this paper is to identify potential use cases for
      automatic methods that analyse critical incident reports. In more detail, we will
      describe how faceted search could offer an intuitive retrieval of critical
      incident reports and how text mining could support in analysing relations among
      events. To realise an automated analysis, natural language processing needs to be
      applied. Therefore, we analyse the language of critical incident reports and
      derive requirements towards automatic processing methods. We learned that there
      is a huge potential for an automatic analysis of incident reports, but there are 
      still challenges to be solved.

TI  - Extraction of UMLS(R) Concepts Using Apache cTAKES for German Language.
PG  - 71-6
AB  - Automatic information extraction of medical concepts and classification with
      semantic standards from medical reports is useful for standardization and for
      clinical research. This paper presents an approach for an UMLS concept extraction
      with a customized natural language processing pipeline for German clinical notes 
      using Apache cTAKES. The objectives are, to test the natural language processing 
      tool for German language if it is suitable to identify UMLS concepts and map
      these with SNOMED-CT. The German UMLS database and German OpenNLP models extended
      the natural language processing pipeline, so the pipeline can normalize to domain
      ontologies such as SNOMED-CT using the German concepts. For testing, the
      ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 training dataset translated into German was used. The
      implemented algorithms are tested with a set of 199 German reports, obtaining a
      result of average 0.36 F1 measure without German stemming, pre- and
      post-processing of the reports.

AB  - We report on the generation of versatile patterns of multiple rectangular
      noise-like pulses (NLPs) in a fiber laser mode-locked by nonlinear amplifying
      loop mirror (NALM). Benefiting from the strengthened nonlinear effect of a
      segment of highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) in the loop, multiple rectangular NLPs
      with various patterns are formed depending on the cavity parameter settings. In
      particular, the multiple rectangular NLPs could possess unequal packet durations,
      which is different from the conventional multi-soliton patterns. The experimental
      results contribute to further understanding the characteristics of the
      rectangular NLP and the dynamics of multi-pulse patterns.

AB  - Bifidobacteria are commensal microorganisms of the human and animal intestinal
      tract, and their surface proteins can mediate bacterial communication and
      chemical sensing in the environment, as well as facilitate interactions between
      bacteria and the host. However, a systematic study of the outer
      surface-associated proteome of bifidobacteria has not been undertaken. In the
      present study, the proteins located on the surface of Bifidobacterium animalis
      ssp. lactis KLDS 2.0603 were systematically identified by a nongel proteomic
      approach, which consisted of the shaving of the bacterial surface with trypsin
      and an analysis of the released peptides by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry. A total of 105 surface-associated proteins were found, of which 15 
      proteins could potentially be involved in adhesion and interactions between
      bifidobacteria and the host. The proteins related to adhesion and interaction
      between bacteria and the host include pilus structure proteins (Fim A, Fim B), 10
      moonlighting proteins, an NLP/P60 family protein, an immunogenic secreted
      protein, and a putative sugar-binding secreted protein. The results provide the
      basis for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of the interactions between 
      bifidobacteria and the host.

TI  - Active learning for ontological event extraction incorporating named entity
      recognition and unknown word handling.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s13326-016-0059-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biomedical text mining may target various kinds of valuable
      information embedded in the literature, but a critical obstacle to the extension 
      of the mining targets is the cost of manual construction of labeled data, which
      are required for state-of-the-art supervised learning systems. Active learning is
      to choose the most informative documents for the supervised learning in order to 
      reduce the amount of required manual annotations. Previous works of active
      learning, however, focused on the tasks of entity recognition and protein-protein
      interactions, but not on event extraction tasks for multiple event types. They
      also did not consider the evidence of event participants, which might be a clue
      for the presence of events in unlabeled documents. Moreover, the confidence
      scores of events produced by event extraction systems are not reliable for
      ranking documents in terms of informativity for supervised learning. We here
      propose a novel committee-based active learning method that supports multi-event 
      extraction tasks and employs a new statistical method for informativity
      estimation instead of using the confidence scores from event extraction systems. 
      METHODS: Our method is based on a committee of two systems as follows: We first
      employ an event extraction system to filter potential false negatives among
      unlabeled documents, from which the system does not extract any event. We then
      develop a statistical method to rank the potential false negatives of unlabeled
      documents 1) by using a language model that measures the probabilities of the
      expression of multiple events in documents and 2) by using a named entity
      recognition system that locates the named entities that can be event arguments
      (e.g. proteins). The proposed method further deals with unknown words in test
      data by using word similarity measures. We also apply our active learning method 
      for the task of named entity recognition. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We evaluate the
      proposed method against the BioNLP Shared Tasks datasets, and show that our
      method can achieve better performance than such previous methods as entropy and
      Gibbs error based methods and a conventional committee-based method. We also show
      that the incorporation of named entity recognition into the active learning for
      event extraction and the unknown word handling further improve the active
      learning method. In addition, the adaptation of the active learning method into
      named entity recognition tasks also improves the document selection for manual
      annotation of named entities.

TI  - Natural Language Processing in Oncology: A Review.
PG  - 797-804
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.0213 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to accelerate
      translation of cancer treatments from the laboratory to the clinic and will be a 
      powerful tool in the era of personalized medicine. This technology can harvest
      important clinical variables trapped in the free-text narratives within
      electronic medical records. OBSERVATIONS: Natural language processing can be used
      as a tool for oncological evidence-based research and quality improvement.
      Oncologists interested in applying NLP for clinical research can play pivotal
      roles in building NLP systems and, in doing so, contribute to both oncological
      and clinical NLP research. Herein, we provide an introduction to NLP and its
      potential applications in oncology, a description of specific tools available,
      and a review on the state of the current technology with respect to cancer case
      identification, staging, and outcomes quantification. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      More automated means of leveraging unstructured data from daily clinical practice
      is crucial as therapeutic options and access to individual-level health
      information increase. Research-minded oncologists may push the avenues of
      evidence-based research by taking advantage of the new technologies available
      with clinical NLP. As continued progress is made with applying NLP toward
      oncological research, incremental gains will lead to large impacts, building a
      cost-effective infrastructure for advancing cancer care.

TI  - A Natural Language Processing Tool for Large-Scale Data Extraction from
      Echocardiography Reports.
PG  - e0153749
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0153749 [doi]
AB  - Large volumes of data are continuously generated from clinical notes and
      diagnostic studies catalogued in electronic health records (EHRs).
      Echocardiography is one of the most commonly ordered diagnostic tests in
      cardiology. This study sought to explore the feasibility and reliability of using
      natural language processing (NLP) for large-scale and targeted extraction of
      multiple data elements from echocardiography reports. An NLP tool, EchoInfer, was
      developed to automatically extract data pertaining to cardiovascular structure
      and function from heterogeneously formatted echocardiographic data sources.
      EchoInfer was applied to echocardiography reports (2004 to 2013) available from 3
      different on-going clinical research projects. EchoInfer analyzed 15,116
      echocardiography reports from 1684 patients, and extracted 59 quantitative and 21
      qualitative data elements per report. EchoInfer achieved a precision of 94.06%, a
      recall of 92.21%, and an F1-score of 93.12% across all 80 data elements in 50
      reports. Physician review of 400 reports demonstrated that EchoInfer achieved a
      recall of 92-99.9% and a precision of >97% in four data elements, including three
      quantitative and one qualitative data element. Failure of EchoInfer to correctly 
      identify or reject reported parameters was primarily related to non-standardized 
      reporting of echocardiography data. EchoInfer provides a powerful and reliable
      NLP-based approach for the large-scale, targeted extraction of information from
      heterogeneous data sources. The use of EchoInfer may have implications for the
      clinical management and research analysis of patients undergoing
      echocardiographic evaluation.

TI  - Electronic medical record phenotyping using the anchor and learn framework.
PG  - 731-40
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocw011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMRs) hold a tremendous amount of
      information about patients that is relevant to determining the optimal approach
      to patient care. As medicine becomes increasingly precise, a patient's electronic
      medical record phenotype will play an important role in triggering clinical
      decision support systems that can deliver personalized recommendations in real
      time. Learning with anchors presents a method of efficiently learning
      statistically driven phenotypes with minimal manual intervention. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We developed a phenotype library that uses both structured and
      unstructured data from the EMR to represent patients for real-time clinical
      decision support. Eight of the phenotypes were evaluated using retrospective EMR 
      data on emergency department patients using a set of prospectively gathered gold 
      standard labels. RESULTS: We built a phenotype library with 42 publicly available
      phenotype definitions. Using information from triage time, the phenotype
      classifiers have an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of infection 0.89, cancer
      0.88, immunosuppressed 0.85, septic shock 0.93, nursing home 0.87, anticoagulated
      0.83, cardiac etiology 0.89, and pneumonia 0.90. Using information available at
      the time of disposition from the emergency department, the AUC values are
      infection 0.91, cancer 0.95, immunosuppressed 0.90, septic shock 0.97, nursing
      home 0.91, anticoagulated 0.94, cardiac etiology 0.92, and pneumonia 0.97.
      DISCUSSION: The resulting phenotypes are interpretable and fast to build, and
      perform comparably to statistically learned phenotypes developed with 5000
      manually labeled patients. CONCLUSION: Learning with anchors is an attractive
      option for building a large public repository of phenotype definitions that can
      be used for a range of health IT applications, including real-time decision
      support.

PG  - 758-65
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocw030 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Genomic profiling information is frequently available to
      oncologists, enabling targeted cancer therapy. Because clinically relevant
      information is rapidly emerging in the literature and elsewhere, there is a need 
      for informatics technologies to support targeted therapies. To this end, we have 
      developed a system for Automated Identification of Molecular Effects of Drugs, to
      help biomedical scientists curate this literature to facilitate decision support.
      OBJECTIVES: To create an automated system to identify assertions in the
      literature concerning drugs targeting genes with therapeutic implications and
      characterize the challenges inherent in automating this process in rapidly
      evolving domains. METHODS: We used subject-predicate-object triples (semantic
      predications) and co-occurrence relations generated by applying the SemRep
      Natural Language Processing system to MEDLINE abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov
      descriptions. We applied customized semantic queries to find drugs targeting
      genes of interest. The results were manually reviewed by a team of experts.
      RESULTS: Compared to a manually curated set of relationships, recall, precision, 
      and F2 were 0.39, 0.21, and 0.33, respectively, which represents a 3- to 4-fold
      improvement over a publically available set of predications (SemMedDB) alone.
      Upon review of ostensibly false positive results, 26% were considered relevant
      additions to the reference set, and an additional 61% were considered to be
      relevant for review. Adding co-occurrence data improved results for drugs in
      early development, but not their better-established counterparts. CONCLUSIONS:
      Precision medicine poses unique challenges for biomedical informatics systems
      that help domain experts find answers to their research questions. Further
      research is required to improve the performance of such systems, particularly for
      drugs in development.

TI  - Determinants of Smoking and Quitting in HIV-Infected Individuals.
PG  - e0153103
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0153103 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is widespread among HIV-infected patients, who
      confront increased risk of smoking-related co-morbidities. The effects of HIV
      infection and HIV-related variables on smoking and smoking cessation are
      incompletely understood. We investigated the correlates of smoking and quitting
      in an HIV-infected cohort using a validated natural language processor to
      determine smoking status. METHOD: We developed and validated an algorithm using
      natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain smoking status from electronic
      health record data. The algorithm was applied to records for a cohort of 3487
      HIV-infected from a large health care system in Boston, USA, and 9446 uninfected 
      control patients matched 3:1 on age, gender, race and clinical encounters. NLP
      was used to identify and classify smoking-related portions of free-text notes.
      These classifications were combined into patient-year smoking status and used to 
      classify patients as ever versus never smokers and current smokers versus
      non-smokers. Generalized linear models were used to assess associations of HIV
      with 3 outcomes, ever smoking, current smoking, and current smoking in analyses
      limited to ever smokers (persistent smoking), while adjusting for demographics,
      cardiovascular risk factors, and psychiatric illness. Analyses were repeated
      within the HIV cohort, with the addition of CD4 cell count and HIV viral load to 
      assess associations of these HIV-related factors with the smoking outcomes.
      RESULTS: Using the natural language processing algorithm to assign annual smoking
      status yielded sensitivity of 92.4, specificity of 86.2, and AUC of 0.89 (95%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.91). Ever and current smoking were more common in
      HIV-infected patients than controls (54% vs. 44% and 42% vs. 30%, respectively,
      both P<0.001). In multivariate models HIV was independently associated with ever 
      smoking (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] 1.18, 95% CI 1.13-1.24, P <0.001), current
      smoking (ARR 1.33, 95% CI 1.25-1.40, P<0.001), and persistent smoking (ARR 1.11, 
      95% CI 1.07-1.15, P<0.001). Within the HIV cohort, having a detectable HIV RNA
      was significantly associated with all three smoking outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: HIV
      was independently associated with both smoking and not quitting smoking, using a 
      novel algorithm to ascertain smoking status from electronic health record data
      and accounting for multiple confounding clinical factors. Further research is
      needed to identify HIV-related barriers to smoking cessation and develop
      aggressive interventions specific to HIV-infected patients.

TI  - Adverse Events in Robotic Surgery: A Retrospective Study of 14 Years of FDA Data.
PG  - e0151470
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0151470 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery has rapidly
      increased during the last decade. Understanding the causes of adverse events and 
      their impact on patients in robot-assisted surgery will help improve systems and 
      operational practices to avoid incidents in the future. METHODS: By developing an
      automated natural language processing tool, we performed a comprehensive analysis
      of the adverse events reported to the publicly available MAUDE database
      (maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) from 2000 to 2013. We
      determined the number of events reported per procedure and per surgical
      specialty, the most common types of device malfunctions and their impact on
      patients, and the potential causes for catastrophic events such as patient
      injuries and deaths. RESULTS: During the study period, 144 deaths (1.4% of the
      10,624 reports), 1,391 patient injuries (13.1%), and 8,061 device malfunctions
      (75.9%) were reported. The numbers of injury and death events per procedure have 
      stayed relatively constant (mean = 83.4, 95% confidence interval (CI), 74.2-92.7 
      per 100,000 procedures) over the years. Surgical specialties for which robots are
      extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had lower numbers of injuries, 
      deaths, and conversions per procedure than more complex surgeries, such as
      cardiothoracic and head and neck (106.3 vs. 232.9 per 100,000 procedures, Risk
      Ratio = 2.2, 95% CI, 1.9-2.6). Device and instrument malfunctions, such as
      falling of burnt/broken pieces of instruments into the patient (14.7%),
      electrical arcing of instruments (10.5%), unintended operation of instruments
      (8.6%), system errors (5%), and video/imaging problems (2.6%), constituted a
      major part of the reports. Device malfunctions impacted patients in terms of
      injuries or procedure interruptions. In 1,104 (10.4%) of all the events, the
      procedure was interrupted to restart the system (3.1%), to convert the procedure 
      to non-robotic techniques (7.3%), or to reschedule it (2.5%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Despite widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery in 
      the U.S., a non-negligible number of technical difficulties and complications are
      still being experienced during procedures. Adoption of advanced techniques in
      design and operation of robotic surgical systems and enhanced mechanisms for
      adverse event reporting may reduce these preventable incidents in the future.

TI  - Crowding-Induced Mixing Behavior of Lipid Bilayers: Examination of Mixing Energy,
      Phase, Packing Geometry, and Reversibility.
PG  - 4688-97
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00831 [doi]
AB  - In an effort to develop a general thermodynamic model from first-principles to
      describe the mixing behavior of lipid membranes, we examined lipid mixing induced
      by targeted binding of small (Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)) and large
      (nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs)) structures to specific phases of
      phase-separated lipid bilayers. Phases were targeted by incorporation of
      phase-partitioning iminodiacetic acid (IDA)-functionalized lipids into ternary
      lipid mixtures consisting of DPPC, DOPC, and cholesterol. GFP and NLPs,
      containing histidine tags, bound the IDA portion of these lipids via a metal,
      Cu(2+), chelating mechanism. In giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), GFP and NLPs
      bound to the Lo domains of bilayers containing DPIDA, and bound to the Ld region 
      of bilayers containing DOIDA. At sufficiently large concentrations of DPIDA or
      DOIDA, lipid mixing was induced by bound GFP and NLPs. The validity of the
      thermodynamic model was confirmed when it was found that the statistical mixing
      distribution as a function of crowding energy for smaller GFP and larger NLPs
      collapsed to the same trend line for each GUV composition. Moreover, results of
      this analysis show that the free energy of mixing for a ternary lipid bilayer
      consisting of DOPC, DPPC, and cholesterol varied from 7.9 x 10(-22) to 1.5 x
      10(-20) J/lipid at the compositions observed, decreasing as the relative
      cholesterol concentration was increased. It was discovered that there appears to 
      be a maximum packing density, and associated maximum crowding pressure, of the
      NLPs, suggestive of circular packing. A similarity in mixing induced by NLP1 and 
      NLP3 despite large difference in projected areas was analytically consistent with
      monovalent (one histidine tag) versus divalent (two histidine tags) surface
      interactions, respectively. In addition to GUVs, binding and induced mixing
      behavior of NLPs was also observed on planar, supported lipid multibilayers. The 
      mixing process was reversible, with Lo domains reappearing after addition of EDTA
      for NLP removal.

AB  - Extracting medical knowledge by structured data mining of many medical records
      and from unstructured data mining of natural language source text on the Internet
      will become increasingly important for clinical decision support. Output from
      these sources can be transformed into large numbers of elements of knowledge in a
      Knowledge Representation Store (KRS), here using the notation and to some extent 
      the algebraic principles of the Q-UEL Web-based universal exchange and inference 
      language described previously, rooted in Dirac notation from quantum mechanics
      and linguistic theory. In a KRS, semantic structures or statements about the
      world of interest to medicine are analogous to natural language sentences seen as
      formed from noun phrases separated by verbs, prepositions and other descriptions 
      of relationships. A convenient method of testing and better curating these
      elements of knowledge is by having the computer use them to take the test of a
      multiple choice medical licensing examination. It is a venture which perhaps
      tells us almost as much about the reasoning of students and examiners as it does 
      about the requirements for Artificial Intelligence as employed in clinical
      decision making. It emphasizes the role of context and of contextual
      probabilities as opposed to the more familiar intrinsic probabilities, and of a
      preliminary form of logic that we call presyllogistic reasoning.

TI  - Natural Language Processing in Radiology: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 329-43
LID - 10.1148/radiol.16142770 [doi]
AB  - Radiological reporting has generated large quantities of digital content within
      the electronic health record, which is potentially a valuable source of
      information for improving clinical care and supporting research. Although
      radiology reports are stored for communication and documentation of diagnostic
      imaging, harnessing their potential requires efficient and automated information 
      extraction: they exist mainly as free-text clinical narrative, from which it is a
      major challenge to obtain structured data. Natural language processing (NLP)
      provides techniques that aid the conversion of text into a structured
      representation, and thus enables computers to derive meaning from human (ie,
      natural language) input. Used on radiology reports, NLP techniques enable
      automatic identification and extraction of information. By exploring the various 
      purposes for their use, this review examines how radiology benefits from NLP. A
      systematic literature search identified 67 relevant publications describing NLP
      methods that support practical applications in radiology. This review takes a
      close look at the individual studies in terms of tasks (ie, the extracted
      information), the NLP methodology and tools used, and their application purpose
      and performance results. Additionally, limitations, future challenges, and
      requirements for advancing NLP in radiology will be discussed.

      predictive modeling of colorectal cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Machine learning techniques can be used to extract predictive models
      for diseases from electronic medical records (EMRs). However, the nature of EMRs 
      makes it difficult to apply off-the-shelf machine learning techniques while still
      exploiting the rich content of the EMRs. In this paper, we explore the usage of a
      range of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract valuable
      predictors from uncoded consultation notes and study whether they can help to
      improve predictive performance. METHODS: We study a number of existing techniques
      for the extraction of predictors from the consultation notes, namely a bag of
      words based approach and topic modeling. In addition, we develop a dedicated
      technique to match the uncoded consultation notes with a medical ontology. We
      apply these techniques as an extension to an existing pipeline to extract
      predictors from EMRs. We evaluate them in the context of predictive modeling for 
      colorectal cancer (CRC), a disease known to be difficult to diagnose before
      performing an endoscopy. RESULTS: Our results show that we are able to extract
      useful information from the consultation notes. The predictive performance of the
      ontology-based extraction method moves significantly beyond the benchmark of age 
      and gender alone (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
      0.870 versus 0.831). We also observe more accurate predictive models by adding
      features derived from processing the consultation notes compared to solely using 
      coded data (AUC of 0.896 versus 0.882) although the difference is not
      significant. The extracted features from the notes are shown be equally
      predictive (i.e. there is no significant difference in performance) compared to
      the coded data of the consultations. CONCLUSION: It is possible to extract useful
      predictors from uncoded consultation notes that improve predictive performance.
      Techniques linking text to concepts in medical ontologies to derive these
      predictors are shown to perform best for predicting CRC in our EMR dataset.

      preoperative characteristics and postoperative course of each patient were
      analyzed. RESULTS: In 31 eyes (70%), the primary indication for a Kpro was failed
      corneal transplantation. The remaining 13 eyes (30%) had Kpro as a primary
      procedure. In all eyes, preoperative visual acuity (VA) was 20/150 or worse, with
      39 eyes (89%) having a VA of counting fingers, hand movement, or light
      perception. Mean follow-up time was 21 +/- 12 months (range 12-57 months). The
      retention rate at the last follow-up was 95%. Best-achieved median VA was 20/100 
      (range 20/20 to no light perception [NLP]), with 37% of patients achieving a VA
      of >20/40 at some point during their postoperative course. At the last follow-up,
      median VA was 20/400 (range 20/30 to NLP). The 2 most common complications
      included retroprosthetic membrane formation (23 eyes, 52%) and elevated
      intraocular pressure (10 eyes, 23%). There were 5 cases (11%) of stromal melt and
      1 case (2%) of infective keratitis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that
      Kpro improves VA in a majority of cases, and is a viable option in situations in 
      which there is a poor prognosis for traditional penetrating keratoplasty.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Discharging patients from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can
      be delayed for non-medical reasons including the procurement of home medical
      equipment, parental education, and the need for children's services. We
      previously created a model to identify patients that will be medically ready for 
      discharge in the subsequent 2-10 days. In this study we use Natural Language
      Processing to improve upon that model and discern why the model performed poorly 
      on certain patients. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the text of the
      Assessment and Plan section from daily progress notes of 4,693 patients (103,206 
      patient-days) from the NICU of a large, academic children's hospital. A matrix
      was constructed using words from NICU notes (single words and bigrams) to train a
      supervised machine learning algorithm to determine the most important words
      differentiating poorly performing patients compared to well performing patients
      in our original discharge prediction model. RESULTS: NLP using a bag of words
      (BOW) analysis revealed several cohorts that performed poorly in our original
      model. These included patients with surgical diagnoses, pulmonary hypertension,
      retinopathy of prematurity, and psychosocial issues. DISCUSSION: The BOW approach
      aided in cohort discovery and will allow further refinement of our original
      discharge model prediction. Adequately identifying patients discharged home on
      g-tube feeds alone could improve the AUC of our original model by 0.02.
      Additionally, this approach identified social issues as a major cause for delayed
      discharge. CONCLUSION: A BOW analysis provides a method to improve and refine our
      NICU discharge prediction model and could potentially avoid over 900 (0.9%)
      hospital days.

TI  - Sortal anaphora resolution to enhance relation extraction from biomedical
      literature.
PG  - 163
LID - 10.1186/s12859-016-1009-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Entity coreference is common in biomedical literature and it can
      affect text understanding systems that rely on accurate identification of named
      entities, such as relation extraction and automatic summarization. Coreference
      resolution is a foundational yet challenging natural language processing task
      which, if performed successfully, is likely to enhance such systems
      significantly. In this paper, we propose a semantically oriented, rule-based
      method to resolve sortal anaphora, a specific type of coreference that forms the 
      majority of coreference instances in biomedical literature. The method addresses 
      all entity types and relies on linguistic components of SemRep, a broad-coverage 
      biomedical relation extraction system. It has been incorporated into SemRep,
      extending its core semantic interpretation capability from sentence level to
      discourse level. RESULTS: We evaluated our sortal anaphora resolution method in
      several ways. The first evaluation specifically focused on sortal anaphora
      relations. Our methodology achieved a F1 score of 59.6 on the test portion of a
      manually annotated corpus of 320 Medline abstracts, a 4-fold improvement over the
      baseline method. Investigating the impact of sortal anaphora resolution on
      relation extraction, we found that the overall effect was positive, with 50 % of 
      the changes involving uninformative relations being replaced by more specific and
      informative ones, while 35 % of the changes had no effect, and only 15 % were
      negative. We estimate that anaphora resolution results in changes in about 1.5 % 
      of approximately 82 million semantic relations extracted from the entire PubMed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that a heavily semantic approach to sortal
      anaphora resolution is largely effective for biomedical literature. Our
      evaluation and error analysis highlight some areas for further improvements, such
      as coordination processing and intra-sentential antecedent selection.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 101(7) of
      Journal of Applied Psychology (see record 2016-32115-001). In the article the
      affiliations for Emily D. Campion and Matthew H. Reider were originally
      incorrect. All versions of this article have been corrected.] Emerging
      advancements including the exponentially growing availability of
      computer-collected data and increasingly sophisticated statistical software have 
      led to a "Big Data Movement" wherein organizations have begun attempting to use
      large-scale data analysis to improve their effectiveness. Yet, little is known
      regarding how organizations can leverage these advancements to develop more
      effective personnel selection procedures, especially when the data are
      unstructured (text-based). Drawing on literature on natural language processing, 
      we critically examine the possibility of leveraging advances in text mining and
      predictive modeling computer software programs as a surrogate for human raters in
      a selection context. We explain how to "train" a computer program to emulate a
      human rater when scoring accomplishment records. We then examine the reliability 
      of the computer's scores, provide preliminary evidence of their construct
      validity, demonstrate that this practice does not produce scores that
      disadvantage minority groups, illustrate the positive financial impact of
      adopting this practice in an organization (N approximately 46,000 candidates),
      and discuss implementation issues. Finally, we discuss the potential implications
      of using computer scoring to address the adverse impact-validity dilemma. We
      suggest that it may provide a cost-effective means of using predictors that have 
      comparable validity but have previously been too expensive for large-scale
      screening. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - MicrO: an ontology of phenotypic and metabolic characters, assays, and culture
      media found in prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/s13326-016-0060-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicrO is an ontology of microbiological terms, including prokaryotic 
      qualities and processes, material entities (such as cell components), chemical
      entities (such as microbiological culture media and medium ingredients), and
      assays. The ontology was built to support the ongoing development of a natural
      language processing algorithm, MicroPIE (or, Microbial Phenomics Information
      Extractor). During the MicroPIE design process, we realized there was a need for 
      a prokaryotic ontology which would capture the evolutionary diversity of
      phenotypes and metabolic processes across the tree of life, capture the diversity
      of synonyms and information contained in the taxonomic literature, and relate
      microbiological entities and processes to terms in a large number of other
      ontologies, most particularly the Gene Ontology (GO), the Phenotypic Quality
      Ontology (PATO), and the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI). We
      thus constructed MicrO to be rich in logical axioms and synonyms gathered from
      the taxonomic literature. RESULTS: MicrO currently has ~14550 classes (~2550 of
      which are new, the remainder being microbiologically-relevant classes imported
      from other ontologies), connected by ~24,130 logical axioms (5,446 of which are
      new), and is available at (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MicrO.owl) and on the
      project website at https://github.com/carrineblank/MicrO. MicrO has been
      integrated into the OBO Foundry Library
      (http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/micro.html), so that other ontologies can
      borrow and re-use classes. Term requests and user feedback can be made using
      MicrO's Issue Tracker in GitHub. We designed MicrO such that it can support the
      ongoing and future development of algorithms that can leverage the controlled
      vocabulary and logical inference power provided by the ontology. CONCLUSIONS: By 
      connecting microbial classes with large numbers of chemical entities, material
      entities, biological processes, molecular functions, and qualities using a dense 
      array of logical axioms, we intend MicrO to be a powerful new tool to increase
      the computing power of bioinformatics tools such as the automated text mining of 
      prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions using natural language processing. We also
      intend MicrO to support the development of new bioinformatics tools that aim to
      develop new connections between microbial phenotypes and genotypes (i.e., the
      gene content in genomes). Future ontology development will include incorporation 
      of pathogenic phenotypes and prokaryotic habitats.

TI  - BRONCO: Biomedical entity Relation ONcology COrpus for extracting
      gene-variant-disease-drug relations.
LID - 10.1093/database/baw043 [doi]
LID - baw043 [pii]
AB  - Comprehensive knowledge of genomic variants in a biological context is key for
      precision medicine. As next-generation sequencing technologies improve, the
      amount of literature containing genomic variant data, such as new functions or
      related phenotypes, rapidly increases. Because numerous articles are published
      every day, it is almost impossible to manually curate all the variant information
      from the literature. Many researchers focus on creating an improved automated
      biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) method that extracts useful
      variants and their functional information from the literature. However, there is 
      no gold-standard data set that contains texts annotated with variants and their
      related functions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Biomedical
      entity Relation ONcology COrpus (BRONCO) that contains more than 400 variants and
      their relations with genes, diseases, drugs and cell lines in the context of
      cancer and anti-tumor drug screening research. The variants and their relations
      were manually extracted from 108 full-text articles. BRONCO can be utilized to
      evaluate and train new methods used for extracting biomedical entity relations
      from full-text publications, and thus be a valuable resource to the biomedical
      text mining research community. Using BRONCO, we quantitatively and qualitatively
      evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art BioNLP methods. We also
      identified their shortcomings, and suggested remedies for each method. We
      implemented post-processing modules for the three BioNLP methods, which improved 
      their performance.Database URL:http://infos.korea.ac.kr/bronco.

TI  - DiMeX: A Text Mining System for Mutation-Disease Association Extraction.
PG  - e0152725
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0152725 [doi]
AB  - The number of published articles describing associations between mutations and
      diseases is increasing at a fast pace. There is a pressing need to gather such
      mutation-disease associations into public knowledge bases, but manual curation
      slows down the growth of such databases. We have addressed this problem by
      developing a text-mining system (DiMeX) to extract mutation to disease
      associations from publication abstracts. DiMeX consists of a series of natural
      language processing modules that preprocess input text and apply syntactic and
      semantic patterns to extract mutation-disease associations. DiMeX achieves high
      precision and recall with F-scores of 0.88, 0.91 and 0.89 when evaluated on three
      different datasets for mutation-disease associations. DiMeX includes a separate
      component that extracts mutation mentions in text and associates them with genes.
      This component has been also evaluated on different datasets and shown to achieve
      state-of-the-art performance. The results indicate that our system outperforms
      the existing mutation-disease association tools, addressing the low precision
      problems suffered by most approaches. DiMeX was applied on a large set of
      abstracts from Medline to extract mutation-disease associations, as well as other
      relevant information including patient/cohort size and population data. The
      results are stored in a database that can be queried and downloaded at
      http://biotm.cis.udel.edu/dimex/. We conclude that this high-throughput
      text-mining approach has the potential to significantly assist researchers and
      curators to enrich mutation databases.

TI  - Using Nonexperts for Annotating Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Mentions in
      Product Labeling: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - e40
LID - 10.2196/resprot.5028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because vital details of potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug
      interactions are often described in free-text structured product labels, manual
      curation is a necessary but expensive step in the development of electronic
      drug-drug interaction information resources. The use of nonexperts to annotate
      potential drug-drug interaction (PDDI) mentions in drug product label annotation 
      may be a means of lessening the burden of manual curation. OBJECTIVE: Our goal
      was to explore the practicality of using nonexpert participants to annotate
      drug-drug interaction descriptions from structured product labels. By presenting 
      annotation tasks to both pharmacy experts and relatively naive participants, we
      hoped to demonstrate the feasibility of using nonexpert annotators for drug-drug 
      information annotation. We were also interested in exploring whether and to what 
      extent natural language processing (NLP) preannotation helped improve task
      completion time, accuracy, and subjective satisfaction. METHODS: Two experts and 
      4 nonexperts were asked to annotate 208 structured product label sections under 4
      conditions completed sequentially: (1) no NLP assistance, (2) preannotation of
      drug mentions, (3) preannotation of drug mentions and PDDIs, and (4) a repeat of 
      the no-annotation condition. Results were evaluated within the 2 groups and
      relative to an existing gold standard. Participants were asked to provide reports
      on the time required to complete tasks and their perceptions of task difficulty. 
      RESULTS: One of the experts and 3 of the nonexperts completed all tasks.
      Annotation results from the nonexpert group were relatively strong in every
      scenario and better than the performance of the NLP pipeline. The expert and 2 of
      the nonexperts were able to complete most tasks in less than 3 hours. Usability
      perceptions were generally positive (3.67 for expert, mean of 3.33 for
      nonexperts). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that nonexpert annotation might be 
      a feasible option for comprehensive labeling of annotated PDDIs across a broader 
      range of drug product labels. Preannotation of drug mentions may ease the
      annotation task. However, preannotation of PDDIs, as operationalized in this
      study, presented the participants with difficulties. Future work should test if
      these issues can be addressed by the use of better performing NLP and a different
      approach to presenting the PDDI preannotations to users during the annotation
      workflow.

LID - S0160-4120(16)30084-8 [pii]
AB  - In India, more than a billion population is at risk of exposure to ambient fine
      particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration exceeding World Health Organization air 
      quality guideline, posing a serious threat to health. Cause-specific premature
      death from ambient PM2.5 exposure is poorly known for India. Here we develop a
      non-linear power law (NLP) function to estimate the relative risk associated with
      ambient PM2.5 exposure using satellite-based PM2.5 concentration (2001-2010) that
      is bias-corrected against coincident direct measurements. We show that estimate
      of annual premature death in India is lower by 14.7% (19.2%) using NLP
      (integrated exposure risk function, IER) for assumption of uniform baseline
      mortality across India (as considered in the global burden of disease study)
      relative to the estimate obtained by adjusting for state-specific baseline
      mortality using GDP as a proxy. 486,100 (811,000) annual premature death in India
      is estimated using NLP (IER) risk functions after baseline mortality adjustment. 
      54.5% of premature death estimated using NLP risk function is attributed to
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 24.0% to ischemic heart disease
      (IHD), 18.5% to stroke and the remaining 3.0% to lung cancer (LC). 44,900
      (5900-173,300) less premature death is expected annually, if India achieves its
      present annual air quality target of 40mugm(-3). Our results identify the worst
      affected districts in terms of ambient PM2.5 exposure and resulting annual
      premature death and call for initiation of long-term measures through a
      systematic framework of pollution and health data archive.

TI  - Tweet Now, See You In the ED Later? Examining the Association Between
      Alcohol-related Tweets and Emergency Care Visits.
PG  - 831-4
LID - 10.1111/acem.12983 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is a major and unpredictable driver of emergency
      department (ED) visits. Regional Twitter activity correlates ecologically with
      behavioral outcomes. No such correlation has been established in real time.
      OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine the correlation between real-time,
      alcohol-related tweets and alcohol-related ED visits. METHODS: We developed and
      piloted a set of 11 keywords that identified tweets related to alcohol use.
      In-state tweets were identified using self-declared profile information or
      geographic coordinates. Using Datasift, a third-party vendor, a random sample of 
      1% of eligible tweets containing the keywords and originating in state were
      downloaded (including tweet date/time) over 3 discrete weeks in 3 different
      months. In the same time frame, we examined visits to an urban, high-volume,
      Level I trauma center that receives > 25% of the emergency care volume in the
      state. Alcohol-related ED visits were defined as visits with a chief complaint of
      alcohol use, positive blood alcohol, or alcohol-related ICD-9 code. Spearman's
      correlation coefficient was used to examine the hourly correlation between
      alcohol-related tweets, alcohol-related ED visits, and all ED visits. RESULTS: A 
      total of 7,820 tweets (representing 782,000 in-state alcohol-related tweets
      during the 3 weeks) were identified. Concurrently, 404 ED visits met criteria for
      being alcohol-related versus 2939 non-alcohol-related ED visits. There was a
      statistically significant relationship between hourly alcohol-related tweet
      volume and number of alcohol-related ED visits (rs = 0.31, p < 0.00001), but not 
      between hourly alcohol-related tweet volume and number of non-alcohol-related ED 
      visits (rs = -0.07, p = 0.11). CONCLUSION: In a single state, a statistically
      significant relationship was observed between the hourly number of
      alcohol-related tweets and the hourly number of alcohol-related ED visits.
      Real-time Twitter monitoring may help predict alcohol-related surges in ED
      visits. Future studies should include larger numbers of EDs and natural language 
      processing.

TI  - Developing a web-based SKOS editor.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/s13326-015-0043-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) was introduced to the
      wider research community by a 2005 World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) working draft,
      and further developed and refined in a 2009 W3C recommendation. Since then, SKOS 
      has become the de facto standard for representing and sharing thesauri, lexicons,
      vocabularies, taxonomies, and classification schemes. In this paper, we describe 
      the development of a web-based, free, open-source SKOS editor built for the
      development, curation, and management of small to medium-sized lexicons for
      health-related Natural Language Processing (NLP). RESULTS: The web-based SKOS
      editor allows users to create, curate, version, manage, and visualise SKOS
      resources. We tested the system against five widely-used, publicly-available SKOS
      vocabularies of various sizes and found that the editor is suitable for the
      development and management of small to medium-size lexicons. Qualitative testing 
      has focussed on using the editor to develop lexical resources to drive NLP
      applications in two domains. First, developing a lexicon to support an Electronic
      Health Record-based NLP system for the automatic identification of pneumonia
      symptoms. Second, creating a taxonomy of lexical cues associated with Diagnostic 
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) diagnoses with the goal of
      facilitating the automatic identification of symptoms associated with depression 
      from short, informal texts. CONCLUSIONS: The SKOS editor we have developed is -
      to the best of our knowledge - the first free, open-source, web-based, SKOS
      editor capable of creating, curating, versioning, managing, and visualising SKOS 
      lexicons.

TI  - Yelp Reviews Of Hospital Care Can Supplement And Inform Traditional Surveys Of
      The Patient Experience Of Care.
PG  - 697-705
LID - 10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1030 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about how real-time online rating platforms such as Yelp may
      complement the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems
      (HCAHPS) survey, which is the US standard for evaluating patients' experiences
      after hospitalization. We compared the content of Yelp narrative reviews of
      hospitals to the topics in the HCAHPS survey, called domains in HCAHPS
      terminology. While the domains included in Yelp reviews covered the majority of
      HCAHPS domains, Yelp reviews covered an additional twelve domains not found in
      HCAHPS. The majority of Yelp topics that most strongly correlate with positive or
      negative reviews are not measured or reported by HCAHPS. The large collection of 
      patient- and caregiver-centered experiences found on Yelp can be analyzed with
      natural language processing methods, identifying for policy makers the measures
      of hospital quality that matter most to patients and caregivers. The Yelp
      measures and analysis can also provide actionable feedback for hospitals.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Data extraction from original study reports is a time-consuming,
      error-prone process in systematic review development. Information extraction (IE)
      systems have the potential to assist humans in the extraction task, however
      majority of IE systems were not designed to work on Portable Document Format
      (PDF) document, an important and common extraction source for systematic review. 
      In a PDF document, narrative content is often mixed with publication metadata or 
      semi-structured text, which add challenges to the underlining natural language
      processing algorithm. Our goal is to categorize PDF texts for strategic use by IE
      systems. METHODS: We used an open-source tool to extract raw texts from a PDF
      document and developed a text classification algorithm that follows a multi-pass 
      sieve framework to automatically classify PDF text snippets (for brevity, texts) 
      into TITLE, ABSTRACT, BODYTEXT, SEMISTRUCTURE, and METADATA categories. To
      validate the algorithm, we developed a gold standard of PDF reports that were
      included in the development of previous systematic reviews by the Cochrane
      Collaboration. In a two-step procedure, we evaluated (1) classification
      performance, and compared it with machine learning classifier, and (2) the
      effects of the algorithm on an IE system that extracts clinical outcome mentions.
      RESULTS: The multi-pass sieve algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.6%, which was 
      9.7% (p<0.001) higher than the best performing machine learning classifier that
      used a logistic regression algorithm. F-measure improvements were observed in the
      classification of TITLE (+15.6%), ABSTRACT (+54.2%), BODYTEXT (+3.7%),
      SEMISTRUCTURE (+34%), and MEDADATA (+14.2%). In addition, use of the algorithm to
      filter semi-structured texts and publication metadata improved performance of the
      outcome extraction system (F-measure +4.1%, p=0.002). It also reduced of number
      of sentences to be processed by 44.9% (p<0.001), which corresponds to a
      processing time reduction of 50% (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The rule-based
      multi-pass sieve framework can be used effectively in categorizing texts
      extracted from PDF documents. Text classification is an important prerequisite
      step to leverage information extraction from PDF documents.

TI  - Social Media, Big Data, and Mental Health: Current Advances and Ethical
      Implications.
PG  - 77-82
AB  - Mental health (including substance abuse) is the fifth greatest contributor to
      the global burden of disease, with an economic cost estimated to be US $2.5
      trillion in 2010, and expected to double by 2030. Developing information systems 
      to support and strengthen population-level mental health monitoring forms a core 
      part of the World Health Organization's Comprehensive Action Plan 2013-2020. In
      this paper, we review recent work that utilizes social media "big data" in
      conjunction with associated technologies like natural language processing and
      machine learning to address pressing problems in population-level mental health
      surveillance and research, focusing both on technological advances and core
      ethical challenges.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We live our lives by the calendar and the clock, but
      time is also an abstraction, even an illusion. The sense of time can be both
      domain-specific and complex, and is often left implicit, requiring significant
      domain knowledge to accurately recognize and harness. In the clinical domain, the
      momentum gained from recent advances in infrastructure and governance practices
      has enabled the collection of tremendous amount of data at each moment in time.
      Electronic health records (EHRs) have paved the way to making these data
      available for practitioners and researchers. However, temporal data
      representation, normalization, extraction and reasoning are very important in
      order to mine such massive data and therefore for constructing the clinical
      timeline. The objective of this work is to provide an overview of the problem of 
      constructing a timeline at the clinical point of care and to summarize the
      state-of-the-art in processing temporal information of clinical narratives.
      METHODS: This review surveys the methods used in three important area: modeling
      and representing of time, medical NLP methods for extracting time, and methods of
      time reasoning and processing. The review emphasis on the current existing gap
      between present methods and the semantic web technologies and catch up with the
      possible combinations. RESULTS: The main findings of this review are revealing
      the importance of time processing not only in constructing timelines and clinical
      decision support systems but also as a vital component of EHR data models and
      operations. CONCLUSIONS: Extracting temporal information in clinical narratives
      is a challenging task. The inclusion of ontologies and semantic web will lead to 
      better assessment of the annotation task and, together with medical NLP
      techniques, will help resolving granularity and co-reference resolution problems.

TI  - Efficient identification of nationally mandated reportable cancer cases using
      natural language processing and machine learning.
PG  - 1077-1084
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocw006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To help cancer registrars efficiently and accurately identify
      reportable cancer cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Cancer Registry Control Panel 
      (CRCP) was developed to detect mentions of reportable cancer cases using a
      pipeline built on the Unstructured Information Management Architecture -
      Asynchronous Scaleout (UIMA-AS) architecture containing the National Library of
      Medicine's UIMA MetaMap annotator as well as a variety of rule-based UIMA
      annotators that primarily act to filter out concepts referring to nonreportable
      cancers. CRCP inspects pathology reports nightly to identify pathology records
      containing relevant cancer concepts and combines this with diagnosis codes from
      the Clinical Electronic Data Warehouse to identify candidate cancer patients
      using supervised machine learning. Cancer mentions are highlighted in all
      candidate clinical notes and then sorted in CRCP's web interface for faster
      validation by cancer registrars. RESULTS: CRCP achieved an accuracy of 0.872 and 
      detected reportable cancer cases with a precision of 0.843 and a recall of 0.848.
      CRCP increases throughput by 22.6% over a baseline (manual review) pathology
      report inspection system while achieving a higher precision and recall. Depending
      on registrar time constraints, CRCP can increase recall to 0.939 at the expense
      of precision by incorporating a data source information feature. CONCLUSION: CRCP
      demonstrates accurate results when applying natural language processing features 
      to the problem of detecting patients with cases of reportable cancer from
      clinical notes. We show that implementing only a portion of cancer reporting
      rules in the form of regular expressions is sufficient to increase the precision,
      recall, and speed of the detection of reportable cancer cases when combined with 
      off-the-shelf information extraction software and machine learning.

      clinical and genomic research. Often, investigators create and iteratively refine
      phenotype algorithms to achieve high positive predictive values (PPVs) or
      sensitivity, thereby identifying valid cases and controls. These algorithms
      achieve the greatest utility when validated and shared by multiple health care
      systems.Materials and Methods We report the current status and impact of the
      Phenotype KnowledgeBase (PheKB, http://phekb.org), an online environment
      supporting the workflow of building, sharing, and validating electronic phenotype
      algorithms. We analyze the most frequent components used in algorithms and their 
      performance at authoring institutions and secondary implementation sites.
      RESULTS: As of June 2015, PheKB contained 30 finalized phenotype algorithms and
      62 algorithms in development spanning a range of traits and diseases. Phenotypes 
      have had over 3500 unique views in a 6-month period and have been reused by other
      institutions. International Classification of Disease codes were the most
      frequently used component, followed by medications and natural language
      processing. Among algorithms with published performance data, the median PPV was 
      nearly identical when evaluated at the authoring institutions (n = 44; case
      96.0%, control 100%) compared to implementation sites (n = 40; case 97.5%,
      control 100%). DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that a broad range of
      algorithms to mine electronic health record data from different health systems
      can be developed with high PPV, and algorithms developed at one site are
      generally transportable to others. CONCLUSION: By providing a central repository,
      PheKB enables improved development, transportability, and validity of algorithms 
      for research-grade phenotypes using health care generated data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic medical records (EMRs) are increasingly repurposed for
      activities beyond clinical care, such as to support translational research and
      public policy analysis. To mitigate privacy risks, healthcare organizations
      (HCOs) aim to remove potentially identifying patient information. A substantial
      quantity of EMR data is in natural language form and there are concerns that
      automated tools for detecting identifiers are imperfect and leak information that
      can be exploited by ill-intentioned data recipients. Thus, HCOs have been
      encouraged to invest as much effort as possible to find and detect potential
      identifiers, but such a strategy assumes the recipients are sufficiently
      incentivized and capable of exploiting leaked identifiers. In practice, such an
      assumption may not hold true and HCOs may overinvest in de-identification
      technology. The goal of this study is to design a natural language
      de-identification framework, rooted in game theory, which enables an HCO to
      optimize their investments given the expected capabilities of an adversarial
      recipient. METHODS: We introduce a Stackelberg game to balance risk and utility
      in natural language de-identification. This game represents a cost-benefit model 
      that enables an HCO with a fixed budget to minimize their investment in the
      de-identification process. We evaluate this model by assessing the overall payoff
      to the HCO and the adversary using 2100 clinical notes from Vanderbilt University
      Medical Center. We simulate several policy alternatives using a range of
      parameters, including the cost of training a de-identification model and the loss
      in data utility due to the removal of terms that are not identifiers. In
      addition, we compare policy options where, when an attacker is fined for misuse, 
      a monetary penalty is paid to the publishing HCO as opposed to a third party
      (e.g., a federal regulator). RESULTS: Our results show that when an HCO is forced
      to exhaust a limited budget (set to $2000 in the study), the precision and recall
      of the de-identification of the HCO are 0.86 and 0.8, respectively. A game-based 
      approach enables a more refined cost-benefit tradeoff, improving both privacy and
      utility for the HCO. For example, our investigation shows that it is possible for
      an HCO to release the data without spending all their budget on de-identification
      and still deter the attacker, with a precision of 0.77 and a recall of 0.61 for
      the de-identification. There also exist scenarios in which the model indicates an
      HCO should not release any data because the risk is too great. In addition, we
      find that the practice of paying fines back to a HCO (an artifact of suing for
      breach of contract), as opposed to a third party such as a federal regulator, can
      induce an elevated level of data sharing risk, where the HCO is incentivized to
      bait the attacker to elicit compensation. CONCLUSIONS: A game theoretic framework
      can be applied in leading HCO's to optimized decision making in natural language 
      de-identification investments before sharing EMR data.

TI  - Cross-Domain Recognition by Identifying Joint Subspaces of Source Domain and
      Target Domain.
AB  - This paper introduces a new method to solve the cross-domain recognition problem.
      Different from the traditional domain adaption methods which rely on a global
      domain shift for all classes between the source and target domains, the proposed 
      method is more flexible to capture individual class variations across domains. By
      adopting a natural and widely used assumption that the data samples from the same
      class should lay on an intrinsic low-dimensional subspace, even if they come from
      different domains, the proposed method circumvents the limitation of the global
      domain shift, and solves the cross-domain recognition by finding the joint
      subspaces of the source and target domains. Specifically, given labeled samples
      in the source domain, we construct a subspace for each of the classes. Then we
      construct subspaces in the target domain, called anchor subspaces, by collecting 
      unlabeled samples that are close to each other and are highly likely to belong to
      the same class. The corresponding class label is then assigned by minimizing a
      cost function which reflects the overlap and topological structure consistency
      between subspaces across the source and target domains, and within the anchor
      subspaces, respectively. We further combine the anchor subspaces to the
      corresponding source subspaces to construct the joint subspaces. Subsequently,
      one-versus-rest support vector machine classifiers are trained using the data
      samples belonging to the same joint subspaces and applied to unlabeled data in
      the target domain. We evaluate the proposed method on two widely used datasets:
      1) object recognition dataset for computer vision tasks and 2) sentiment
      classification dataset for natural language processing tasks. Comparison results 
      demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparison methods on both
      datasets.

TI  - Expression and Association of the Yersinia pestis Translocon Proteins, YopB and
      YopD, Are Facilitated by Nanolipoprotein Particles.
PG  - e0150166
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0150166 [doi]
AB  - Yersinia pestis enters host cells and evades host defenses, in part, through
      interactions between Yersinia pestis proteins and host membranes. One such
      interaction is through the type III secretion system, which uses a highly
      conserved and ordered complex for Yersinia pestis outer membrane effector protein
      translocation called the injectisome. The portion of the injectisome that
      interacts directly with host cell membranes is referred to as the translocon. The
      translocon is believed to form a pore allowing effector molecules to enter host
      cells. To facilitate mechanistic studies of the translocon, we have developed a
      cell-free approach for expressing translocon pore proteins as a complex supported
      in a bilayer membrane mimetic nano-scaffold known as a nanolipoprotein particle
      (NLP) Initial results show cell-free expression of Yersinia pestis outer membrane
      proteins YopB and YopD was enhanced in the presence of liposomes. However, these 
      complexes tended to aggregate and precipitate. With the addition of co-expressed 
      (NLP) forming components, the YopB and/or YopD complex was rendered soluble,
      increasing the yield of protein for biophysical studies. Biophysical methods such
      as Atomic Force Microscopy and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy were used to
      confirm that the soluble YopB/D complex was associated with NLPs. An interaction 
      between the YopB/D complex and NLP was validated by immunoprecipitation. The
      YopB/D translocon complex embedded in a NLP provides a platform for protein
      interaction studies between pathogen and host proteins. These studies will help
      elucidate the poorly understood mechanism which enables this pathogen to inject
      effector proteins into host cells, thus evading host defenses.

TI  - Extracting genetic alteration information for personalized cancer therapy from
      ClinicalTrials.gov.
PG  - 750-7
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocw009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials investigating drugs that target specific genetic
      alterations in tumors are important for promoting personalized cancer therapy.
      The goal of this project is to create a knowledge base of cancer treatment trials
      with annotations about genetic alterations from ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS: We
      developed a semi-automatic framework that combines advanced text-processing
      techniques with manual review to curate genetic alteration information in cancer 
      trials. The framework consists of a document classification system to identify
      cancer treatment trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and an information extraction
      system to extract gene and alteration pairs from the Title and Eligibility
      Criteria sections of clinical trials. By applying the framework to trials at
      ClinicalTrials.gov, we created a knowledge base of cancer treatment trials with
      genetic alteration annotations. We then evaluated each component of the framework
      against manually reviewed sets of clinical trials and generated descriptive
      statistics of the knowledge base. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The automated cancer
      treatment trial identification system achieved a high precision of 0.9944.
      Together with the manual review process, it identified 20 193 cancer treatment
      trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. The automated gene-alteration extraction system
      achieved a precision of 0.8300 and a recall of 0.6803. After validation by manual
      review, we generated a knowledge base of 2024 cancer trials that are labeled with
      specific genetic alteration information. Analysis of the knowledge base revealed 
      the trend of increased use of targeted therapy for cancer, as well as top
      frequent gene-alteration pairs of interest. We expect this knowledge base to be a
      valuable resource for physicians and patients who are seeking information about
      personalized cancer therapy.

AB  - An anammox attached film expanded bed (AAFEB) reactor was operated to study the
      long-term performance and the variation of substrate tolerance ability. The
      results indicated that the nitrogen loading potential (NLP) was significantly
      enhanced from 13.56gN.(L.d)(-)(1) to 20.95gN.(L.d)(-)(1) during the stable
      operation period. The inhibitory concentration of 10% (IC10) for free ammonia
      (FA), free nitrous acid (FNA) and SNinf (diluted substrate concentration)
      increased from 18mg/L, 12mugL(-1) and 370mgNL(-)(1) to 31mg/L, 19mugL(-1) and
      670mgNL(-)(1), respectively. However, the substrate shock of 2500mgNL(-)(1) for
      24h terribly weakened the treatment performance and substrate tolerance ability
      of the reactor. The results of batch tests indicated that the existence of lag
      phase made the AAFEB reactor more vulnerable to substrate variation. The SNinf
      was accurate to be used to monitor the reactor performance and should be
      maintained below 320mgNL(-)(1) to ensure the absolute stable operation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of coping strategies in reducing the adverse effects of
      stress can be helpful. Nero-linguistic programming (NLP) is one of the modern
      methods of psychotherapy. This study aimed to determine the effect of NLP on
      occupational stress in nurses working in critical care units of Urmia. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: This study was carried out quasi-experimentally (before-after) with 
      control and experimental groups. Of all the nurses working in the critical care
      units of Urmia Imam Khomeini and Motahari educational/therapeutic centers, 60
      people participated in this survey. Eighteen sessions of intervention were done, 
      each for 180 min. The experimental group received NLP program (such as goal
      setting, time management, assertiveness skills, representational system, and
      neurological levels, as well as some practical and useful NLP techniques).
      Expanding Nursing Stress Scale (ENSS) was used as the data gathering tool. Data
      were analyzed using SPSS version 16. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test, 
      Mann-Whitney test, and independent t-test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS:
      The baseline score average of job stress was 120.88 and 121.36 for the
      intervention and control groups, respectively (P = 0.65). After intervention, the
      score average of job stress decreased to 64.53 in the experimental group while
      that of control group remained relatively unchanged (120.96). Mann-Whitney test
      results showed that stress scores between the two groups was statistically
      significant (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the use of NLP can
      increase coping with stressful situations, and it can reduce the adverse effects 
      of occupational stress.

AB  - External content sources such as MEDLINE((R)), National Institutes of Health
      (NIH) grants and conference websites provide access to the latest breaking
      biomedical information, which can inform pharmaceutical and biotechnology company
      pipeline decisions. The value of the sites for industry, however, is limited by
      the use of the public internet, the limited synonyms, the rarity of batch
      searching capability and the disconnected nature of the sites. Fortunately, many 
      sites now offer their content for download and we have developed an automated
      internal workflow that uses text mining and tailored ontologies for programmatic 
      search and knowledge extraction. We believe such an efficient and secure approach
      provides a competitive advantage to companies needing access to the latest
      information for a range of use cases and complements manually curated commercial 
      sources.

TI  - Using ApoE Nanolipoprotein Particles To Analyze SNARE-Induced Fusion Pores.
PG  - 3015-23
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00245 [doi]
AB  - Here we introduce ApoE-based nanolipoprotein particle (NLP)-a soluble, discoidal 
      bilayer mimetic of approximately 23 nm in diameter, as fusion partners to study
      the dynamics of fusion pores induced by SNARE proteins. Using in vitro lipid
      mixing and content release assays, we report that NLPs reconstituted with
      synaptic v-SNARE VAMP2 (vNLP) fuse with liposomes containing the cognate t-SNARE 
      (Syntaxin1/SNAP25) partner, with the resulting fusion pore opening directly to
      the external buffer. Efflux of encapsulated fluorescent dextrans of different
      sizes show that unlike the smaller nanodiscs, these larger NLPs accommodate the
      expansion of the fusion pore to at least approximately 9 nm, and dithionite
      quenching of fluorescent lipid introduced in vNLP confirms that the NLP fusion
      pores are short-lived and eventually reseal. The NLPs also have capacity to
      accommodate larger number of proteins and using vNLPs with defined number of
      VAMP2 protein, including physiologically relevant copy numbers, we find that 3-4 
      copies of VAMP2 (minimum 2 per face) are required to keep a nascent fusion pore
      open, and the SNARE proteins act cooperatively to dilate the nascent fusion pore.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2013 binge-eating disorder (BED) was recognized as a formal
      diagnosis, but was historically included under the diagnosis code for eating
      disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). This study compared the characteristics
      and use of treatment modalities in BED patients to those with EDNOS without BED
      (EDNOS-only) and to matched-patients with no eating disorders (NED). METHODS:
      Patients were identified for this study from electronic health records in the
      Department of Veterans Affairs from 2000 to 2011. Patients with BED were
      identified using natural language processing and patients with EDNOS-only were
      identified by ICD-9 code (307.50). First diagnosis defined index date for these
      groups. NED patients were frequency matched to BED patients up to 4:1, as
      available, on age, sex, BMI, depression, and index month encounter. Baseline
      characteristics and use of treatment modalities during the post-index year were
      compared using t-tests or chi-square tests. RESULTS: There were 593 BED, 1354
      EDNOS-only, and 1895 matched-NED patients identified. Only 68 patients with BED
      had an EDNOS diagnosis. BED patients were younger (48.7 vs. 49.8years, p=0.04),
      more were male (72.2% vs. 62.8%, p<0.001) and obese (BMI 40.2 vs. 37.0, p<0.001) 
      than EDNOS-only patients. In the follow-up period fewer BED (68.0%) than
      EDNOS-only patients (87.6%, p<0.001), but more BED than NED patients (51.9%,
      p<0.001) used at least one treatment modality. DISCUSSION: The characteristics of
      BED patients were different from those with EDNOS-only and NED as was their use
      of treatment modalities. These differences highlight the need for a separate
      identifier of BED.

TI  - Plant Phenotyping using Probabilistic Topic Models: Uncovering the Hyperspectral 
      Language of Plants.
PG  - 22482
LID - 10.1038/srep22482 [doi]
AB  - Modern phenotyping and plant disease detection methods, based on optical sensors 
      and information technology, provide promising approaches to plant research and
      precision farming. In particular, hyperspectral imaging have been found to reveal
      physiological and structural characteristics in plants and to allow for tracking 
      physiological dynamics due to environmental effects. In this work, we present an 
      approach to plant phenotyping that integrates non-invasive sensors, computer
      vision, as well as data mining techniques and allows for monitoring how plants
      respond to stress. To uncover latent hyperspectral characteristics of diseased
      plants reliably and in an easy-to-understand way, we "wordify" the hyperspectral 
      images, i.e., we turn the images into a corpus of text documents. Then, we apply 
      probabilistic topic models, a well-established natural language processing
      technique that identifies content and topics of documents. Based on recent
      regularized topic models, we demonstrate that one can track automatically the
      development of three foliar diseases of barley. We also present a visualization
      of the topics that provides plant scientists an intuitive tool for hyperspectral 
      imaging. In short, our analysis and visualization of characteristic topics found 
      during symptom development and disease progress reveal the hyperspectral language
      of plant diseases.

TI  - Knowledge-Driven Event Extraction in Russian: Corpus-Based Linguistic Resources.
PG  - 4183760
LID - 10.1155/2016/4183760 [doi]
AB  - Automatic event extraction form text is an important step in knowledge
      acquisition and knowledge base population. Manual work in development of
      extraction system is indispensable either in corpus annotation or in vocabularies
      and pattern creation for a knowledge-based system. Recent works have been focused
      on adaptation of existing system (for extraction from English texts) to new
      domains. Event extraction in other languages was not studied due to the lack of
      resources and algorithms necessary for natural language processing. In this paper
      we define a set of linguistic resources that are necessary in development of a
      knowledge-based event extraction system in Russian: a vocabulary of subordination
      models, a vocabulary of event triggers, and a vocabulary of Frame Elements that
      are basic building blocks for semantic patterns. We propose a set of methods for 
      creation of such vocabularies in Russian and other languages using Google Books
      NGram Corpus. The methods are evaluated in development of event extraction system
      for Russian.

TI  - Burden and Depression in Caregivers of Blind Patients in New York State.
PG  - 162-70
LID - 10.3109/09286586.2015.1099684 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the degree of burden of care and the proportion at risk of
      depression among individuals caring for legally blind patients. METHODS: We
      performed a cross-sectional study of 486 individuals providing care to their
      family members who were legally blind. Best-corrected visual acuity of the
      better-seeing eye in patients determined group placement: Group 1, 20/200-10/200;
      group 2, 10/200 to light perception (LP); group 3, no light perception (NLP);
      group VF, visual field loss to <20 central degrees. Burden was evaluated using
      the Burden Index of Caregivers (BIC-11) and the prevalence at risk of depression 
      was determined by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. 
      RESULTS: Total mean BIC-11 scores ranged from 8.78 +/- 4.82 (group 1) to 12.03
      +/- 5.22 (group 3; p = 0.04). Daily hours spent on close supervision, intensity
      of caregiving and presence of multiple chronic illnesses in caregivers were the
      significant covariates affecting BIC-11 scores (p < 0.05). The prevalence of
      caregivers at risk of depression increased with vision loss from 6.9% (group 1)
      to 17.9% (group 3; p < 0.05). Female caregivers had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.89
      for depression (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.07-3.97; p = 0.04). Caregivers
      with >/=2 comorbidities had OR 4.24 (95% CI 2.41-6.11) for risk of depression (p 
      < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Burden of care was highest among caregivers who provided
      greater hours of supervision. Patients with more limitations in their activities 
      of daily living had caregivers who reported higher burden. Female caregivers and 
      caregivers with multiple chronic illnesses were at higher risk of depression.

TI  - Nocturnal Light Pulses Lower Carbon Dioxide Production Rate without Affecting
      Feed Intake in Geese.
PG  - 390-5
LID - 10.5713/ajas.15.0236 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effect of nocturnal light pulses
      (NLPs) on the feed intake and metabolic rate in geese. Fourteen adult Chinese
      geese were penned individually, and randomly assigned to either the C (control)
      or NLP group. The C group was exposed to a 12L:12D photoperiod (12 h light and 12
      h darkness per day), whereas the NLP group was exposed to a 12L:12D photoperiod
      inserted by 15-min lighting at 2-h intervals in the scotophase. The weight of the
      feed was automatically recorded at 1-min intervals for 1 wk. The fasting carbon
      dioxide production rate (CO2 PR) was recorded at 1-min intervals for 1 d. The
      results revealed that neither the daily feed intake nor the feed intakes during
      both the daytime and nighttime were affected by photoperiodic regimen, and the
      feed intake during the daytime did not differ from that during the nighttime. The
      photoperiodic treatment did not affect the time distribution of feed intake.
      However, NLPs lowered (p<0.05) the mean and minimal CO2 PR during both the
      daytime and nighttime. Both the mean and minimal CO2 PR during the daytime were
      significantly higher (p<0.05) than those during the nighttime. We concluded that 
      NLPs lowered metabolic rate of the geese, but did not affect the feed intake;
      both the mean and minimal CO2 PR were higher during the daytime than during the
      nighttime.

TI  - Model-based optimal design of experiments - semidefinite and nonlinear
      programming formulations.
PG  - 153-163
AB  - We use mathematical programming tools, such as Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and
      Nonlinear Programming (NLP)-based formulations to find optimal designs for models
      used in chemistry and chemical engineering. In particular, we employ local
      design-based setups in linear models and a Bayesian setup in nonlinear models to 
      find optimal designs. In the latter case, Gaussian Quadrature Formulas (GQFs) are
      used to evaluate the optimality criterion averaged over the prior distribution
      for the model parameters. Mathematical programming techniques are then applied to
      solve the optimization problems. Because such methods require the design space be
      discretized, we also evaluate the impact of the discretization scheme on the
      generated design. We demonstrate the techniques for finding D-, A- and E-optimal 
      designs using design problems in biochemical engineering and show the method can 
      also be directly applied to tackle additional issues, such as heteroscedasticity 
      in the model. Our results show that the NLP formulation produces highly efficient
      D-optimal designs but is computationally less efficient than that required for
      the SDP formulation. The efficiencies of the generated designs from the two
      methods are generally very close and so we recommend the SDP formulation in
      practice.

TI  - Heterogeneity of non-cancerous liver parenchyma on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI:
      an imaging biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma development in chronic liver
      disease.

LID - 10.1016/j.crad.2016.01.023 [doi]
LID - S0009-9260(16)00045-3 [pii]
AB  - AIM: To clarify whether the heterogeneity of non-cancerous liver parenchyma (NLP)
      in the hepatobiliary phase on gadoxetic acid enhanced magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) is correlated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained, and the
      requirements for informed consent were waived for this retrospective study. The
      imaging characteristics of 84 patients with chronic liver disease who underwent
      gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3T MRI between January 2013 and October 2014 were
      examined retrospectively. For the evaluation of the heterogeneity of the
      intensity in the hepatobiliary phase, the largest possible region of interest was
      placed on the NLP, and the skewness and kurtosis were calculated using ImageJ
      software. Skewness is the degree of asymmetry of a histogram, and kurtosis is a
      measure of the peak. Based on the median values of kurtosis and skewness, the
      patients were classified into four categories and the categories were compared
      between the 49 patients with HCC (HCC group) and the 35 patients without HCC
      (non-HCC group). RESULTS: Kurtosis was significantly higher in the HCC group
      compared to the non-HCC group (1.19+/-1.15 versus 0.43+/-0.83; p=0.0006).
      Skewness was significantly lower in the HCC group than in the non-HCC group
      (1.19+/-1.15 versus 0.43+/-0.83; p=0.0152). In a multivariate logistic analysis, 
      the category showing lower-than-the-median (-0.1185) skewness and
      higher-than-the-median (0.547) kurtosis was significantly and independently
      associated with HCC development (p=0.0031). CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of NLP 
      in the hepatobiliary phase on gadoxetic acid enhanced MRI may reflect the
      development of HCC.

AB  - Motivational interviewing (MI) is an efficacious treatment for substance use
      disorders and other problem behaviors. Studies on MI fidelity and mechanisms of
      change typically use human raters to code therapy sessions, which requires
      considerable time, training, and financial costs. Natural language processing
      techniques have recently been utilized for coding MI sessions using machine
      learning techniques, rather than human coders, and preliminary results have
      suggested these methods hold promise. The current study extends this previous
      work by introducing two natural language processing models for automatically
      coding MI sessions via computer. The two models differ in the way they
      semantically represent session content, utilizing either 1) simple discrete
      sentence features (DSF model) and 2) more complex recursive neural networks (RNN 
      model). Utterance- and session-level predictions from these models were compared 
      to ratings provided by human coders using a large sample of MI sessions (N=341
      sessions; 78,977 clinician and client talk turns) from 6 MI studies. Results show
      that the DSF model generally had slightly better performance compared to the RNN 
      model. The DSF model had "good" or higher utterance-level agreement with human
      coders (Cohen's kappa>0.60) for open and closed questions, affirm, giving
      information, and follow/neutral (all therapist codes); considerably higher
      agreement was obtained for session-level indices, and many estimates were
      competitive with human-to-human agreement. However, there was poor agreement for 
      client change talk, client sustain talk, and therapist MI-inconsistent behaviors.
      Natural language processing methods provide accurate representations of human
      derived behavioral codes and could offer substantial improvements to the
      efficiency and scale in which MI mechanisms of change research and fidelity
      monitoring are conducted.

AB  - Drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction as a typical relation extraction task in
      natural language processing (NLP) has always attracted great attention. Most
      state-of-the-art DDI extraction systems are based on support vector machines
      (SVM) with a large number of manually defined features. Recently, convolutional
      neural networks (CNN), a robust machine learning method which almost does not
      need manually defined features, has exhibited great potential for many NLP tasks.
      It is worth employing CNN for DDI extraction, which has never been investigated. 
      We proposed a CNN-based method for DDI extraction. Experiments conducted on the
      2013 DDIExtraction challenge corpus demonstrate that CNN is a good choice for DDI
      extraction. The CNN-based DDI extraction method achieves an F-score of 69.75%,
      which outperforms the existing best performing method by 2.75%.

TI  - Valx: A System for Extracting and Structuring Numeric Lab Test Comparison
      Statements from Text.
PG  - 266-75
LID - 10.3414/ME15-01-0112 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop an automated method for extracting and structuring numeric
      lab test comparison statements from text and evaluate the method using clinical
      trial eligibility criteria text. METHODS: Leveraging semantic knowledge from the 
      Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and domain knowledge acquired from the
      Internet, Valx takes seven steps to extract and normalize numeric lab test
      expressions: 1) text preprocessing, 2) numeric, unit, and comparison operator
      extraction, 3) variable identification using hybrid knowledge, 4) variable -
      numeric association, 5) context-based association filtering, 6) measurement unit 
      normalization, and 7) heuristic rule-based comparison statements verification.
      Our reference standard was the consensus-based annotation among three raters for 
      all comparison statements for two variables, i.e., HbA1c and glucose, identified 
      from all of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes trials in ClinicalTrials.gov. RESULTS: The
      precision, recall, and F-measure for structuring HbA1c comparison statements were
      99.6%, 98.1%, 98.8% for Type 1 diabetes trials, and 98.8%, 96.9%, 97.8% for Type 
      2 diabetes trials, respectively. The precision, recall, and F-measure for
      structuring glucose comparison statements were 97.3%, 94.8%, 96.1% for Type 1
      diabetes trials, and 92.3%, 92.3%, 92.3% for Type 2 diabetes trials,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Valx is effective at extracting and structuring
      free-text lab test comparison statements in clinical trial summaries. Future
      studies are warranted to test its generalizability beyond eligibility criteria
      text. The open-source Valx enables its further evaluation and continued
      improvement among the collaborative scientific community.

TI  - Association of cannabis use with hospital admission and antipsychotic treatment
      failure in first episode psychosis: an observational study.
PG  - e009888
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009888 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cannabis use is associated with increased risk 
      of relapse, as indexed by number of hospital admissions, and whether
      antipsychotic treatment failure, as indexed by number of unique antipsychotics
      prescribed, may mediate this effect in a large data set of patients with first
      episode psychosis (FEP). DESIGN: Observational study with exploratory mediation
      analysis. SETTING: Anonymised electronic mental health record data from the South
      London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. PARTICIPANTS: 2026 people presenting to
      early intervention services with FEP. EXPOSURE: Cannabis use at presentation,
      identified using natural language processing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: admission to
      psychiatric hospital and clozapine prescription up to 5 years following
      presentation. MEDIATOR: Number of unique antipsychotics prescribed. RESULTS:
      Cannabis use was present in 46.3% of the sample at first presentation and was
      particularly common in patients who were 16-25, male and single. It was
      associated with increased frequency of hospital admission (incidence rate ratio
      1.50, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.80), increased likelihood of compulsory admission (OR
      1.55, 1.16 to 2.08) and greater number of days spent in hospital (beta
      coefficient 35.1 days, 12.1 to 58.1). The number of unique antipsychotics
      prescribed, mediated increased frequency of hospital admission (natural indirect 
      effect 1.09, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.18; total effect 1.50, 1.21 to 1.87), increased
      likelihood of compulsory admission (natural indirect effect (NIE) 1.27, 1.03 to
      1.58; total effect (TE) 1.76, 0.81 to 3.84) and greater number of days spent in
      hospital (NIE 17.9, 2.4 to 33.4; TE 34.8, 11.6 to 58.1). CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis
      use in patients with FEP was associated with an increased likelihood of hospital 
      admission. This was linked to the prescription of several different antipsychotic
      drugs, indicating clinical judgement of antipsychotic treatment failure.
      Together, this suggests that cannabis use might be associated with worse clinical
      outcomes in psychosis by contributing towards failure of antipsychotic treatment.

TI  - Bio-SCoRes: A Smorgasbord Architecture for Coreference Resolution in Biomedical
      Text.
PG  - e0148538
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0148538 [doi]
AB  - Coreference resolution is one of the fundamental and challenging tasks in natural
      language processing. Resolving coreference successfully can have a significant
      positive effect on downstream natural language processing tasks, such as
      information extraction and question answering. The importance of coreference
      resolution for biomedical text analysis applications has increasingly been
      acknowledged. One of the difficulties in coreference resolution stems from the
      fact that distinct types of coreference (e.g., anaphora, appositive) are
      expressed with a variety of lexical and syntactic means (e.g., personal pronouns,
      definite noun phrases), and that resolution of each combination often requires a 
      different approach. In the biomedical domain, it is common for coreference
      annotation and resolution efforts to focus on specific subcategories of
      coreference deemed important for the downstream task. In the current work, we aim
      to address some of these concerns regarding coreference resolution in biomedical 
      text. We propose a general, modular framework underpinned by a smorgasbord
      architecture (Bio-SCoRes), which incorporates a variety of coreference types,
      their mentions and allows fine-grained specification of resolution strategies to 
      resolve coreference of distinct coreference type-mention pairs. For development
      and evaluation, we used a corpus of structured drug labels annotated with
      fine-grained coreference information. In addition, we evaluated our approach on
      two other corpora (i2b2/VA discharge summaries and protein coreference dataset)
      to investigate its generality and ease of adaptation to other biomedical text
      types. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of our novel smorgasbord
      architecture. The specific pipelines based on the architecture perform
      successfully in linking coreferential mention pairs, while we find that
      recognition of full mention clusters is more challenging. The corpus of
      structured drug labels (SPL) as well as the components of Bio-SCoRes and some of 
      the pipelines based on it are publicly available at
      https://github.com/kilicogluh/Bio-SCoRes. We believe that Bio-SCoRes can serve as
      a strong and extensible baseline system for coreference resolution of biomedical 
      text.

TI  - Cohort profile of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Biomedical
      Research Centre (SLaM BRC) Case Register: current status and recent enhancement
      of an Electronic Mental Health Record-derived data resource.
PG  - e008721

AB  - PURPOSE: The South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation
      Trust Biomedical Research Centre (SLaM BRC) Case Register and its Clinical Record
      Interactive Search (CRIS) application were developed in 2008, generating a
      research repository of real-time, anonymised, structured and open-text data
      derived from the electronic health record system used by SLaM, a large mental
      healthcare provider in southeast London. In this paper, we update this register's
      descriptive data, and describe the substantial expansion and extension of the
      data resource since its original development. PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive data were
      generated from the SLaM BRC Case Register on 31 December 2014. Currently, there
      are over 250,000 patient records accessed through CRIS. FINDINGS TO DATE: Since
      2008, the most significant developments in the SLaM BRC Case Register have been
      the introduction of natural language processing to extract structured data from
      open-text fields, linkages to external sources of data, and the addition of a
      parallel relational database (Structured Query Language) output. Natural language
      processing applications to date have brought in new and hitherto inaccessible
      data on cognitive function, education, social care receipt, smoking, diagnostic
      statements and pharmacotherapy. In addition, through external data linkages,
      large volumes of supplementary information have been accessed on mortality,
      hospital attendances and cancer registrations. FUTURE PLANS: Coupled with robust 
      data security and governance structures, electronic health records provide
      potentially transformative information on mental disorders and outcomes in
      routine clinical care. The SLaM BRC Case Register continues to grow as a
      database, with approximately 20,000 new cases added each year, in addition to
      extension of follow-up for existing cases. Data linkages and natural language
      processing present important opportunities to enhance this type of research
      resource further, achieving both volume and depth of data. However, research
      projects still need to be carefully tailored, so that they take into account the 
      nature and quality of the source information.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coreference resolution is an essential task in information extraction
      from the published biomedical literature. It supports the discovery of complex
      information by linking referring expressions such as pronouns and appositives to 
      their referents, which are typically entities that play a central role in
      biomedical events. Correctly establishing these links allows detailed
      understanding of all the participants in events, and connecting events together
      through their shared participants. RESULTS: As an initial step towards the
      development of a novel coreference resolution system for the biomedical domain,
      we have categorised the characteristics of coreference relations by type of
      anaphor as well as broader syntactic and semantic characteristics, and have
      compared the performance of a domain adaptation of a state-of-the-art general
      system to published results from domain-specific systems in terms of this
      categorisation. We also develop a rule-based system for anaphoric coreference
      resolution in the biomedical domain with simple modules derived from available
      systems. Our results show that the domain-specific systems outperform the general
      system overall. Whilst this result is unsurprising, our proposed categorisation
      enables a detailed quantitative analysis of the system performance. We identify
      limitations of each system and find that there remain important gaps in the
      state-of-the-art systems, which are clearly identifiable with respect to the
      categorisation. CONCLUSION: We have analysed in detail the performance of
      existing coreference resolution systems for the biomedical literature and have
      demonstrated that there clear gaps in their coverage. The approach developed in
      the general domain needs to be tailored for portability to the biomedical domain.
      The specific framework for class-based error analysis of existing systems that we
      propose has benefits for identifying specific limitations of those systems. This 
      in turn provides insights for further system development.

AB  - Speculations represent uncertainty toward certain facts. In clinical texts,
      identifying speculations is a critical step of natural language processing (NLP).
      While it is a nontrivial task in many languages, detecting speculations in
      Chinese clinical notes can be particularly challenging because word segmentation 
      may be necessary as an upstream operation. The objective of this paper is to
      construct a state-of-the-art speculation detection system for Chinese clinical
      notes and to investigate whether embedding features and word segmentations are
      worth exploiting toward this overall task. We propose a sequence labeling based
      system for speculation detection, which relies on features from bag of
      characters, bag of words, character embedding, and word embedding. We experiment 
      on a novel dataset of 36,828 clinical notes with 5103 gold-standard speculation
      annotations on 2000 notes, and compare the systems in which word embeddings are
      calculated based on word segmentations given by general and by domain specific
      segmenters respectively. Our systems are able to reach performance as high as
      92.2% measured by F score. We demonstrate that word segmentation is critical to
      produce high quality word embedding to facilitate downstream information
      extraction applications, and suggest that a domain dependent word segmenter can
      be vital to such a clinical NLP task in Chinese language.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of late presentation (LP) on overall mortality 
      and causes of death and describe LP trends and risk factors (2004-2013). METHODS:
      Cox models and logistic regression were used to analyze data from a nation-wide
      cohort in Spain. LP is defined as being diagnosed when CD4 < 350 cells/ml or
      AIDS. RESULTS: Of 7165 new HIV diagnoses, 46.9% (CI95%:45.7-48.0) were LP, 240
      patients died. First-year mortality was the highest (aHRLP.vs.nLP =
      10.3[CI95%:5.5-19.3]); between 1 and 4 years post-diagnosis, aHRLP.vs.nLP =
      1.9(1.2-3.0); and >4 years, aHRLP.vs.nLP = 1.5(0.7-3.1). First-year's main cause 
      of death was HIV/AIDS (73%); and malignancies among those surviving >4 years
      (32%). HIV/AIDS-related deaths were more likely in LP (59.2% vs. 25.0%; p <
      0.001). LP declined from 55.9% (2004-05) to 39.4% (2012-13), and reduced in 46.1%
      in men who have sex with men (MSM) and 37.6% in heterosexual men, but increased
      in 22.6% in heterosexual women. Factors associated with LP: sex (ORMEN.vs.WOMEN =
      1.4[1.2-1.7]); age (OR31-40.vs.<30 = 1.6[1.4-1.8], OR41-50.vs.<30 = 2.2[1.8-2.6],
      OR>50.vs.<30 = 3.6[2.9-4.4]); behavior (ORInjectedDrugUse.vs.MSM = 2.8[2.0-3.8]; 
      ORHeterosexual.vs.MSM = 2.2[1.7-3.0]); education
      (ORPrimaryEducation.vs.University = 1.5[1.1-2.0], ORLowerSecondary.vs.University 
      = 1.3[1.1-1.5]); and geographical origin (ORSub-Saharan.vs.Spain = 1.6[1.3-2.0], 
      ORLatin-American.vs.Spain = 1.4[1.2-1.8]). CONCLUSIONS: LP is associated with
      higher mortality, especially short-term- and HIV/AIDS-related mortality.
      Mid-term-, but not long-term mortality, remained also higher in LP than nLP. LP
      decreased in MSM and heterosexual men, not in heterosexual women. The groups most
      affected by LP are low educated, non-Spanish and heterosexual women.

TI  - Automated identification and predictive tools to help identify high-risk heart

PG  - 872-8
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv197 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Develop and evaluate an automated identification and predictive risk
      report for hospitalized heart failure (HF) patients. METHODS: Dictated free-text 
      reports from the previous 24 h were analyzed each day with natural language
      processing (NLP), to help improve the early identification of hospitalized
      patients with HF. A second application that uses an Intermountain
      Healthcare-developed predictive score to determine each HF patient's risk for
      30-day hospital readmission and 30-day mortality was also developed. That
      information was included in an identification and predictive risk report, which
      was evaluated at a 354-bed hospital that treats high-risk HF patients. RESULTS:
      The addition of NLP-identified HF patients increased the identification score's
      sensitivity from 82.6% to 95.3% and its specificity from 82.7% to 97.5%, and the 
      model's positive predictive value is 97.45%. Daily multidisciplinary discharge
      planning meetings are now based on the information provided by the HF
      identification and predictive report, and clinician's review of potential HF
      admissions takes less time compared to the previously used manual methodology (10
      vs 40 min). An evaluation of the use of the HF predictive report identified a
      significant reduction in 30-day mortality and a significant increase in patient
      discharges to home care instead of to a specialized nursing facility.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using clinical decision support to help identify HF patients and
      automatically calculating their 30-day all-cause readmission and 30-day mortality
      risks, coupled with a multidisciplinary care process pathway, was found to be an 
      effective process to improve HF patient identification, significantly reduce
      30-day mortality, and significantly increase patient discharges to home care.

TI  - A method for modeling co-occurrence propensity of clinical codes with application
      to ICD-10-PCS auto-coding.
PG  - 866-71
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv201 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Natural language processing methods for medical auto-coding, or
      automatic generation of medical billing codes from electronic health records,
      generally assign each code independently of the others. They may thus assign
      codes for closely related procedures or diagnoses to the same document, even when
      they do not tend to occur together in practice, simply because the right choice
      can be difficult to infer from the clinical narrative. METHODS: We propose a
      method that injects awareness of the propensities for code co-occurrence into
      this process. First, a model is trained to estimate the conditional probability
      that one code is assigned by a human coder, given than another code is known to
      have been assigned to the same document. Then, at runtime, an iterative algorithm
      is used to apply this model to the output of an existing statistical auto-coder
      to modify the confidence scores of the codes. RESULTS: We tested this method in
      combination with a primary auto-coder for International Statistical
      Classification of Diseases-10 procedure codes, achieving a 12% relative
      improvement in F-score over the primary auto-coder baseline. The proposed method 
      can be used, with appropriate features, in combination with any auto-coder that
      generates codes with different levels of confidence. CONCLUSIONS: The promising
      results obtained for International Statistical Classification of Diseases-10
      procedure codes suggest that the proposed method may have wider applications in
      auto-coding.

TI  - A high-precision rule-based extraction system for expanding geospatial metadata
      in GenBank records.
PG  - 934-41
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv172 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The metadata reflecting the location of the infected host (LOIH) of
      virus sequences in GenBank often lacks specificity. This work seeks to enhance
      this metadata by extracting more specific geographic information from related
      full-text articles and mapping them to their latitude/longitudes using knowledge 
      derived from external geographical databases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed
      a rule-based information extraction framework for linking GenBank records to the 
      latitude/longitudes of the LOIH. Our system first extracts existing geospatial
      metadata from GenBank records and attempts to improve it by seeking additional,
      relevant geographic information from text and tables in related full-text PubMed 
      Central articles. The final extracted locations of the records, based on data
      assimilated from these sources, are then disambiguated and mapped to their
      respective geo-coordinates. We evaluated our approach on a manually annotated
      dataset comprising of 5728 GenBank records for the influenza A virus. RESULTS: We
      found the precision, recall, and f-measure of our system for linking GenBank
      records to the latitude/longitudes of their LOIH to be 0.832, 0.967, and 0.894,
      respectively. DISCUSSION: Our system had a high level of accuracy for linking
      GenBank records to the geo-coordinates of the LOIH. However, it can be further
      improved by expanding our database of geospatial data, incorporating spell
      correction, and enhancing the rules used for extraction. CONCLUSION: Our system
      performs reasonably well for linking GenBank records for the influenza A virus to
      the geo-coordinates of their LOIH based on record metadata and information
      extracted from related full-text articles.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe clinical findings and analyze treatment evolution of
      chronic, non-infectious uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis
      (JIA). METHODS: A total of 82 patients (147 eyes) with JIA-related uveitis
      treated for >/=2 months were included (78% females; 79% bilateral uveitis; 74%
      anterior uveitis). Outcome measures were visual acuity (VA), inflammation
      control, side-effects, and surgical procedures. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD age at
      diagnosis was 4.9 +/- 3.8 years; mean +/- SD follow-up time was 8.7 +/- 7.8
      years. Mean VA did not significantly change throughout the study. Three (2%) eyes
      resulted in no light perception (NLP) vision. Thirty (37%) patients underwent 69 
      procedures. In total, 41 (50%) patients achieved inflammation control. TNF-alpha 
      inhibitors were significantly associated with inflammation control. Seven (8.5%) 
      patients stopped treatment due to side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: JIA is a cause of
      significant ocular morbidity. TNF-alpha inhibitor use was associated with
      inflammation control. Prospective, randomized, double blind clinical trials in
      this regard are warranted.

      choice through functions of ASH-2 trithorax complex in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 21485
LID - 10.1038/srep21485 [doi]
AB  - Preference choice on food is an important response strategy for animals living in
      the environment. Using assay system of preference choice on bacterial foods, OP50
      and PA14, we identified the involvement of ADL sensory neurons in the control of 
      preference choice in Caenorhabditis elegans. Both genetically silencing and
      ChR2-mediated activation of ADL sensory neurons significantly affected preference
      choice. ADL regulated preference choice by inhibiting function of G
      protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)/SRH-220. ADL sensory neurons might regulate
      preference choice through peptidergic signals of FLP-4 and NLP-10, and function
      of FLP-4 or NLP-10 in regulating preference choice was regulated by SRH-220.
      FLP-4 released from ADL sensory neurons further regulated preference choice
      through its receptor of NPR-4 in AIB interneurons. In AIB interneurons, NPR-4 was
      involved in the control of preference choice by activating the functions of ASH-2
      trithorax complex consisting of SET-2, ASH-2, and WDR-5, implying the crucial
      role of molecular machinery of trimethylation of histone H3K4 in the preference
      choice control. The identified novel neuronal circuit and the underlying
      molecular mechanisms will strengthen our understanding neuronal basis of
      preference choice in animals.

TI  - Toward Signaling-Driven Biomarkers Immune to Normal Tissue Contamination.
PG  - 15-21
LID - 10.4137/CIN.S32468 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to discover a minimally invasive pathway-specific
      biomarker that is immune to normal cell mRNA contamination for diagnosing head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Using Elsevier's MedScan natural
      language processing component of the Pathway Studio software and the TRANSFAC
      database, we produced a curated set of genes regulated by the signaling networks 
      driving the development of HNSCC. The network and its gene targets provided prior
      probabilities for gene expression, which guided our CoGAPS matrix factorization
      algorithm to isolate patterns related to HNSCC signaling activity from a
      microarray-based study. Using patterns that distinguished normal from tumor
      samples, we identified a reduced set of genes to analyze with Top Scoring Pair in
      order to produce a potential biomarker for HNSCC. Our proposed biomarker
      comprises targets of the transcription factor (TF) HIF1A and the FOXO family of
      TFs coupled with genes that show remarkable stability across all normal tissues. 
      Based on validation with novel data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), measured
      by RNAseq, and bootstrap sampling, the biomarker for normal vs. tumor has an
      accuracy of 0.77, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.54, and an area under
      the curve (AUC) of 0.82.

      Conversations And Sentiments.

LID - 10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1092 [doi]
AB  - Real-time monitoring of mainstream and social media can inform public health
      practitioners and policy makers about vaccine sentiment and hesitancy. We
      describe a publicly available platform for monitoring vaccination-related
      content, called the Vaccine Sentimeter. With automated data collection from
      100,000 mainstream media sources and Twitter, natural-language processing for
      automated filtering, and manual curation to ensure accuracy, the Vaccine
      Sentimeter offers a global real-time view of vaccination conversations online. To
      assess the system's utility, we followed two events: polio vaccination in
      Pakistan after a news story about a Central Intelligence Agency vaccination ruse 
      and subsequent attacks on health care workers, and a controversial episode in a
      television program about adverse events following human papillomavirus
      vaccination. For both events, increased online activity was detected and
      characterized. For the first event, Twitter response to the attacks on health
      care workers decreased drastically after the first attack, in contrast to
      mainstream media coverage. For the second event, the mainstream and social media 
      response was largely positive about the HPV vaccine, but antivaccine
      conversations persisted longer than the provaccine reaction. Using the Vaccine
      Sentimeter could enable public health professionals to detect increased online
      activity or sudden shifts in sentiment that could affect vaccination uptake.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to determine the effect of 2 different
      potassium regulation strategies with different targets (within the reference
      range) on atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) in a cohort of
      intensive care unit patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: The GRIP-COMPASS
      study was a prospective double-blinded interventional study in 910 patients after
      cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valvular surgery).
      Patients were assigned to either the normal-low potassium target (nLP group, 4.0 
      mmol/L) or the normal-high potassium target (nHP group, 4.5 mmol/L) in
      alternating blocks of 50 patients. Potassium levels were regulated using a
      validated computer-assisted potassium replacement protocol (GRIP-II). The primary
      end point was the incidence of AF/AFL on a 12-lead electrocardiogram during the
      first postoperative week. RESULTS: Of the 910 patients, 447 were assigned to the 
      nLP group; and 463, to the nHP group, with no baseline differences between the 2 
      groups. The mean daily administered dose of potassium was 30 +/- 23 mmol (nLP)
      versus 52 +/- 27 mmol (nHP) (P < .001), which resulted in mean intensive care
      unit potassium concentration of 4.22 +/- 0.36 mmol/L and 4.33 +/- 0.34 mmol/L,
      respectively (P < .001). The incidence of AF/AFL after cardiac surgery did not
      differ: 38% in the nLP group and 41% in the nHP group. Also in several subgroups 
      (eg, patients not known with prior AF/AFL or with valve surgery), there were no
      differences. CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in incidence of AF/AFL with 2
      potassium regulation strategies with different potassium targets and different
      amounts of potassium administered in patients after cardiac surgery.

AB  - Comparative effectiveness research (CER) provides evidence for the relative
      effectiveness and risks of different treatment options and informs decisions made
      by healthcare providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies. CER data come from
      retrospective analyses as well as prospective clinical trials. Here, we describe 
      the development of a text-mining pipeline based on natural language processing
      (NLP) that extracts key information from three different trial data sources: NIH 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), 
      and Citeline Trialtrove. The pipeline leverages tailored terminologies to produce
      an integrated and structured output, capturing any trials in which pharmaceutical
      products of interest are compared with another therapy. The timely information
      alerts generated by this system provide the earliest and most complete picture of
      emerging clinical research.

AB  - This paper proposes and discusses the use of text mining techniques for the
      extraction of information from clinical records written in Italian. However, as
      it is very difficult and expensive to obtain annotated material for languages
      different from English, we only consider unsupervised approaches, where no
      annotated training set is necessary. We therefore propose a complete system that 
      is structured in two steps. In the first one domain entities are extracted from
      the clinical records by means of a metathesaurus and standard natural language
      processing tools. The second step attempts to discover relations between the
      entity pairs extracted from the whole set of clinical records. For this last step
      we investigate the performance of unsupervised methods such as clustering in the 
      space of entity pairs, represented by an ad hoc feature vector. The resulting
      clusters are then automatically labelled by using the most significant features. 
      The system has been tested on a fairly large data set of clinical records in
      Italian, investigating the variation in the performance adopting different
      similarity measures in the feature space. The results of our experiments show
      that the unsupervised approach proposed is promising and well suited for a
      semi-automatic labelling of the extracted relations.

TI  - Bridging semantics and syntax with graph algorithms-state-of-the-art of
      extracting biomedical relations.
PG  - 160-178
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbw001 [doi]
AB  - Research on extracting biomedical relations has received growing attention
      recently, with numerous biological and clinical applications including those in
      pharmacogenomics, clinical trial screening and adverse drug reaction detection.
      The ability to accurately capture both semantic and syntactic structures in text 
      expressing these relations becomes increasingly critical to enable deep
      understanding of scientific papers and clinical narratives. Shared task
      challenges have been organized by both bioinformatics and clinical informatics
      communities to assess and advance the state-of-the-art research. Significant
      progress has been made in algorithm development and resource construction. In
      particular, graph-based approaches bridge semantics and syntax, often achieving
      the best performance in shared tasks. However, a number of problems at the
      frontiers of biomedical relation extraction continue to pose interesting
      challenges and present opportunities for great improvement and fruitful research.
      In this article, we place biomedical relation extraction against the backdrop of 
      its versatile applications, present a gentle introduction to its general pipeline
      and shared resources, review the current state-of-the-art in methodology
      advancement, discuss limitations and point out several promising future
      directions.

TI  - Multiple exciton generation induced enhancement of the photoresponse of
      pulsed-laser-ablation synthesized single-wall-carbon-nanotube/PbS-quantum-dots
      nanohybrids.
PG  - 20083
LID - 10.1038/srep20083 [doi]
AB  - The pulsed laser deposition method was used to decorate appropriately single wall
      carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with PbS quantum dots (QDs), leading to the formation
      of a novel class of SWCNTs/PbS-QDs nanohybrids (NHs), without resorting to any
      ligand engineering and/or surface functionalization. The number of laser ablation
      pulses (NLp) was used to control the average size of the PbS-QDs and their
      coverage on the SWCNTs' surface. Photoconductive (PC) devices fabricated from
      these SWCNTs/PbS-QDs NHs have shown a significantly enhanced photoresponse, which
      is found to be PbS-QD size dependent. Wavelength-resolved photocurrent
      measurements revealed a strong photoconductivity of the NHs in the UV-visible
      region, which is shown to be due to multiple exciton generation (MEG) in the
      PbS-QDs. For the 6.5 nm-diameter PbS-QDs (with a bandgap (Eg) = 0.86 eV), the MEG
      contribution of the NHs based PC devices was shown to lead to a normalized
      internal quantum efficiency in excess of 300% for photon energies >/=4.5Eg. While
      the lowest MEG threshold in our NHs based PC devices is found to be of ~2.5Eg,
      the MEG efficiency reaches values as high as 0.9 +/- 0.1.

TI  - Building a Natural Language Processing Tool to Identify Patients With High
      Clinical Suspicion for Kawasaki Disease from Emergency Department Notes.
PG  - 628-36
LID - 10.1111/acem.12925 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Delayed diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) may lead to serious cardiac
      complications. We sought to create and test the performance of a natural language
      processing (NLP) tool, the KD-NLP, in the identification of emergency department 
      (ED) patients for whom the diagnosis of KD should be considered. METHODS: We
      developed an NLP tool that recognizes the KD diagnostic criteria based on
      standard clinical terms and medical word usage using 22 pediatric ED notes
      augmented by Unified Medical Language System vocabulary. With high suspicion for 
      KD defined as fever and three or more KD clinical signs, KD-NLP was applied to
      253 ED notes from children ultimately diagnosed with either KD or another febrile
      illness. We evaluated KD-NLP performance against ED notes manually reviewed by
      clinicians and compared the results to a simple keyword search. RESULTS: KD-NLP
      identified high-suspicion patients with a sensitivity of 93.6% and specificity of
      77.5% compared to notes manually reviewed by clinicians. The tool outperformed a 
      simple keyword search (sensitivity = 41.0%; specificity = 76.3%). CONCLUSIONS:
      KD-NLP showed comparable performance to clinician manual chart review for
      identification of pediatric ED patients with a high suspicion for KD. This tool
      could be incorporated into the ED electronic health record system to alert
      providers to consider the diagnosis of KD. KD-NLP could serve as a model for
      decision support for other conditions in the ED.

      was achieved. However, this recombinant HPIV2 N protein did not form NLPs. The
      PCR mutagenesis was carried out to change the encoded aa residues to the ones
      conserved across HPIV2 isolates. Synthesis of the modified proteins in yeast
      demonstrated that the single aa substitution NP_598401.1:p.D331V was sufficient
      for the self-assembly of NLPs. The significance of certain aa residues in this
      position was confirmed by analysing HPIV2 N protein structure models. To
      characterize the antigenic structure of NLP-forming HPIV2 N protein, a panel of
      monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was generated. The majority of the MAbs raised
      against the recombinant NLPs recognized HPIV2-infected cells suggesting the
      antigenic similarity between the recombinant and virus-derived HPIV2 N protein.
      Fine epitope mapping revealed the C-terminal part (aa 386-504) as the main
      antigenic region of the HPIV2 N protein. In conclusion, the current study
      provides new data on the impact of HPIV2 N protein sequence variants on the NLP
      self-assembly and demonstrates an efficient production of recombinant HPIV2 N
      protein in the form of NLPs.

TI  - Risk Factors Analysis for the Outcome of Indirect Traumatic Optic Neuropathy With
      Steroid Pulse Therapy.
PG  - S60-7
LID - 10.1097/SAP.0000000000000694 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although recent evidence suggests a controversy effect of steroids in
      the management of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (TON), steroid pulse
      therapy remains one of the reasonable treatments for patients with indirect TON. 
      It is thought that microcirculatory spasms, edema, and nerve cell necrosis can be
      prevented or reduced by large doses of steroids. The aim of this study is to
      analyze the predisposing factors for the recovery of patients with indirect TON
      who were treated with steroid pulse therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In tracing
      the 2008 to 2014 data from the Trauma Center of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, 20 
      consecutive cases of indirect TON were identified retrospectively. Twenty cases
      showed no light perception (NLP) under initial ophthalmologic examination. They
      all received steroid pulse therapy with methylprednisolone in IV form after
      examination by ophthalmologists, and they did not receive optic nerve
      decompression. The general data, fracture pattern from images, hospital courses, 
      trauma-related data from ER record, and the initial and final visual data from
      ophthalmologic records are reviewed. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) are calculated. Fisher exact test is used for 2 variables to test 
      differences between proportions. Nonparametric statistics are applied to compare 
      the mean values of the data. RESULTS: The results show that for female patients
      (OR, 3.400; 95% CI, 1.628-7.101; P = 0.049), the administration of
      methylprednisolone in less than 24 hours from the injury (OR, 3.429;
      0.297-39.637), lateral force fracture pattern (OR, 3.500; 0.313-39.153), age of
      40 years or younger (OR, 2.333; 0.197-27.567), and pure facial trauma (OR, 3.667;
      0.273-49.288) are the predisposing factors for improvement of visual acuity.
      Patients with orbital blowout fractures (OR, 9.800; 95% CI, 0.899-106.845; P =
      0.070), initial free extraocular movement (EOM) (OR, 6.667; 0.809-54.597; P =
      0.145), initial intraoptic pressure (IOP) greater than 25 mmHg (OR, 8.000;
      0.598-106.936), and higher triage grade (OR, 3.000; 0.447-20.153) are at risk of 
      showing no improvement. CONCLUSIONS: From this study, we might suggest to apply
      steroid pulse therapy on those patients without contraindication, with an
      incurring injury less than 24 hours previously. Factors such as sex, age, lateral
      force fracture pattern, and pure facial trauma revealed a better outcome for
      improvement of visual acuity. Orbital blowout fractures, initial free EOM,
      initial IOP greater than 25 mmHg, and higher triage grade suggested poor
      improvement of visual acuity.

TI  - Evaluation of PHI Hunter in Natural Language Processing Research.
PG  - 1f
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We introduce and evaluate a new, easily accessible tool using a
      common statistical analysis and business analytics software suite, SAS, which can
      be programmed to remove specific protected health information (PHI) from a text
      document. Removal of PHI is important because the quantity of text documents used
      for research with natural language processing (NLP) is increasing. When using
      existing data for research, an investigator must remove all PHI not needed for
      the research to comply with human subjects' right to privacy. This process is
      similar, but not identical, to de-identification of a given set of documents.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: PHI Hunter removes PHI from free-form text. It is a set of
      rules to identify and remove patterns in text. PHI Hunter was applied to 473
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) text documents randomly drawn from a research
      corpus stored as unstructured text in VA files. RESULTS: PHI Hunter performed
      well with PHI in the form of identification numbers such as Social Security
      numbers, phone numbers, and medical record numbers. The most commonly missed PHI 
      items were names and locations. Incorrect removal of information occurred with
      text that looked like identification numbers. DISCUSSION: PHI Hunter fills a
      niche role that is related to but not equal to the role of de-identification
      tools. It gives research staff a tool to reasonably increase patient privacy. It 
      performs well for highly sensitive PHI categories that are rarely used in
      research, but still shows possible areas for improvement. More development for
      patterns of text and linked demographic tables from electronic health records
      (EHRs) would improve the program so that more precise identifiable information
      can be removed. CONCLUSIONS: PHI Hunter is an accessible tool that can flexibly
      remove PHI not needed for research. If it can be tailored to the specific data
      set via linked demographic tables, its performance will improve in each new
      document set.

TI  - Mitotic regulator Nlp interacts with XPA/ERCC1 complexes and regulates nucleotide
      excision repair (NER) in response to UV radiation.

AB  - Cellular response to DNA damage, including ionizing radiation (IR) and UV
      radiation, is critical for the maintenance of genomic fidelity. Defects of DNA
      repair often result in genomic instability and malignant cell transformation.
      Centrosomal protein Nlp (ninein-like protein) has been characterized as an
      important cell cycle regulator that is required for proper mitotic progression.
      In this study, we demonstrate that Nlp is able to improve nucleotide excision
      repair (NER) activity and protects cells against UV radiation. Upon exposure of
      cells to UVC, Nlp is translocated into the nucleus. The C-terminus (1030-1382) of
      Nlp is necessary and sufficient for its nuclear import. Upon UVC radiation, Nlp
      interacts with XPA and ERCC1, and enhances their association. Interestingly,
      down-regulated expression of Nlp is found to be associated with human skin
      cancers, indicating that dysregulated Nlp might be related to the development of 
      human skin cancers. Taken together, this study identifies mitotic protein Nlp as 
      a new and important member of NER pathway and thus provides novel insights into
      understanding of regulatory machinery involved in NER.

TI  - Systematic analysis of the p53-related microRNAs in breast cancer revealing their
      essential roles in the cell cycle.
PG  - 3488-3494
AB  - Numerous miRNAs have been found to be involved in the regulation of the p53
      signaling pathway. Conversely, p53 regulates the transcription or processing of
      microRNAs (miRNAs). Given that complexities in the association between p53 and
      miRNAs exist, and due to the rapidly increasing amount of literature regarding
      the interactions between p53 and miRNAs, the present study systematically
      analyzed the associations between miRNAs and p53 in breast cancer using a
      literature-based discovery approach, natural language processing. A total of 22
      miRNAs were found to be associated with p53. Next, three popular online tools
      (PicTar, miRanda and TargetScan) were used to predict the targets of each miRNA, 
      and certain targets were validated by experiments. Gene Ontology annotation and
      network analysis demonstrated that the majority of the targets of the p53-related
      miRNAs were enriched in the cell cycle process. These results suggest that, in
      addition to regulating the transcription of cell cycle-related genes, p53 also
      indirectly modulates the cell cycle via miRNAs.

TI  - "It sounds like...": A natural language processing approach to detecting
      counselor reflections in motivational interviewing.
PG  - 343-50
LID - 10.1037/cou0000111 [doi]
AB  - The dissemination and evaluation of evidence-based behavioral treatments for
      substance abuse problems rely on the evaluation of counselor interventions. In
      Motivational Interviewing (MI), a treatment that directs the therapist to utilize
      a particular linguistic style, proficiency is assessed via behavioral coding-a
      time consuming, nontechnological approach. Natural language processing techniques
      have the potential to scale up the evaluation of behavioral treatments such as
      MI. We present a novel computational approach to assessing components of MI,
      focusing on 1 specific counselor behavior-reflections, which are believed to be a
      critical MI ingredient. Using 57 sessions from 3 MI clinical trials, we
      automatically detected counselor reflections in a maximum entropy Markov modeling
      framework using the raw linguistic data derived from session transcripts. We
      achieved 93% recall, 90% specificity, and 73% precision. Results provide insight 
      into the linguistic information used by coders to make ratings and demonstrate
      the feasibility of new computational approaches to scaling up the evaluation of
      behavioral treatments.

TI  - Timing of endoscopic surgical decompression in traumatic optic neuropathy: a
      systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 661-7
LID - 10.1002/alr.21706 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) represents a rare but devastating
      complication of closed head injuries. No accepted guidelines are available for
      medical and surgical management algorithms. A systematic review of the literature
      was performed to determine the optimal timing and candidacy for endoscopic
      surgical intervention. METHODS: A systematic review of multiple databases was
      performed including Medline-Ovid, EMBASE, and PubMed. Data was extracted and
      patients stratified based on surgical delay from trauma (</=3 days, >3 days, </=7
      days, or >7 days) as well as preoperative and postoperative vision testing (no
      light perception [NLP]; light perception [LP]; hand motion [HM]; or finger
      counting [FC] or better). RESULTS: The literature review identified 24 studies
      meeting inclusion criteria. In the group of patients receiving surgery </=3 days 
      after the antecedent event, 57% (105/183) had visual improvement, whereas in the 
      >7-days group 51% (145/283) of patients improved. In those with NLP
      preoperatively, 41% (172/411) saw improvement, whereas those with LP (89%), HM
      (93%), or FC (85%) fared better. CONCLUSION: The literature suggests that
      surgical intervention for TON is indicated despite delayed presentation, and is a
      better choice than no intervention at all. Patients with complete blindness on
      presentation (NLP) tend to have a poorer surgical outcome.

TI  - Language of Uncertainty: the Expression of Decisional Conflict Related to Skin
      Cancer Prevention Recommendations.
AB  - User-generated information on the Internet provides opportunities for the
      monitoring of health information consumer attitudes. For example, information
      about cancer prevention may cause decisional conflict. Yet posts and
      conversations shared by health information consumers online are often not readily
      actionable for interpretation and decision-making due to their unstandardized
      format. This study extends prior research on the use of natural language as a
      predictor of consumer attitudes and provides a link to decision-making by
      evaluating the predictive role of uncertainty indicators expressed in natural
      language. Analyzed data included free-text comments and structured scale
      responses related to information about skin cancer prevention options. The study 
      identified natural language indicators of uncertainty and showed that it can
      serve as a predictor of decisional conflict. The natural indicators of
      uncertainty reported here can facilitate the monitoring of health consumer
      perceptions about cancer prevention recommendations and inform education and
      communication campaign planning and evaluation.

TI  - SOCIAL MEDIA MINING SHARED TASK WORKSHOP.
PG  - 581-92
AB  - Social media has evolved into a crucial resource for obtaining large volumes of
      real-time information. The promise of social media has been realized by the
      public health domain, and recent research has addressed some important challenges
      in that domain by utilizing social media data. Tasks such as monitoring flu
      trends, viral disease outbreaks, medication abuse, and adverse drug reactions are
      some examples of studies where data from social media have been exploited. The
      focus of this workshop is to explore solutions to three important natural
      language processing challenges for domain-specific social media text: (i) text
      classification, (ii) information extraction, and (iii) concept normalization. To 
      explore different approaches to solving these problems on social media data, we
      designed a shared task which was open to participants globally. We designed three
      tasks using our in-house annotated Twitter data on adverse drug reactions. Task 1
      involved automatic classification of adverse drug reaction assertive user posts; 
      Task 2 focused on extracting specific adverse drug reaction mentions from user
      posts; and Task 3, which was slightly ill-defined due to the complex nature of
      the problem, involved normalizing user mentions of adverse drug reactions to
      standardized concept IDs. A total of 11 teams participated, and a total of 24 (18
      for Task 1, and 6 for Task 2) system runs were submitted. Following the
      evaluation of the systems, and an assessment of their innovation/novelty, we
      accepted 7 descriptive manuscripts for publication--5 for Task 1 and 2 for Task
      2. We provide descriptions of the tasks, data, and participating systems in this 
      paper.

TI  - FINDING POTENTIALLY UNSAFE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS FROM USER REVIEWS WITH TOPIC
      MODELING.
PG  - 528-39
AB  - Although dietary supplements are widely used and generally are considered safe,
      some supplements have been identified as causative agents for adverse reactions, 
      some of which may even be fatal. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
      responsible for monitoring supplements and ensuring that supplements are safe.
      However, current surveillance protocols are not always effective. Leveraging
      user-generated textual data, in the form of Amazon.com reviews for nutritional
      supplements, we use natural language processing techniques to develop a system
      for the monitoring of dietary supplements. We use topic modeling techniques,
      specifically a variation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and background
      knowledge in the form of an adverse reaction dictionary to score products based
      on their potential danger to the public. Our approach generates topics that
      semantically capture adverse reactions from a document set consisting of reviews 
      posted by users of specific products, and based on these topics, we propose a
      scoring mechanism to categorize products as "high potential danger", "average
      potential danger" and "low potential danger." We evaluate our system by comparing
      the system categorization with human annotators, and we find that the our system 
      agrees with the annotators 69.4% of the time. With these results, we demonstrate 
      that our methods show promise and that our system represents a proof of concept
      as a viable low-cost, active approach for dietary supplement monitoring.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Most patient care questions raised by clinicians can be answered by
      online clinical knowledge resources. However, important barriers still challenge 
      the use of these resources at the point of care. OBJECTIVE: To design and assess 
      a method for extracting clinically useful sentences from synthesized online
      clinical resources that represent the most clinically useful information for
      directly answering clinicians' information needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      developed a Kernel-based Bayesian Network classification model based on different
      domain-specific feature types extracted from sentences in a gold standard
      composed of 18 UpToDate documents. These features included UMLS concepts and
      their semantic groups, semantic predications extracted by SemRep, patient
      population identified by a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP)
      algorithm, and cue words extracted by a feature selection technique. Algorithm
      performance was measured in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. RESULTS:
      The feature-rich approach yielded an F-measure of 74% versus 37% for a feature
      co-occurrence method (p<0.001). Excluding predication, population, semantic
      concept or text-based features reduced the F-measure to 62%, 66%, 58% and 69%
      respectively (p<0.01). The classifier applied to Medline sentences reached an
      F-measure of 73%, which is equivalent to the performance of the classifier on
      UpToDate sentences (p=0.62). CONCLUSIONS: The feature-rich approach significantly
      outperformed general baseline methods. This approach significantly outperformed
      classifiers based on a single type of feature. Different types of semantic
      features provided a unique contribution to overall classification performance.
      The classifier's model and features used for UpToDate generalized well to Medline
      abstracts.

TI  - Automated Outcome Classification of Computed Tomography Imaging Reports for
      Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury.
PG  - 171-8
LID - 10.1111/acem.12859 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The authors have previously demonstrated highly reliable automated
      classification of free-text computed tomography (CT) imaging reports using a
      hybrid system that pairs linguistic (natural language processing) and statistical
      (machine learning) techniques. Previously performed for identifying the outcome
      of orbital fracture in unprocessed radiology reports from a clinical data
      repository, the performance has not been replicated for more complex outcomes.
      OBJECTIVES: To validate automated outcome classification performance of a hybrid 
      natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning system for brain CT
      imaging reports. The hypothesis was that our system has performance
      characteristics for identifying pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: 
      This was a secondary analysis of a subset of 2,121 CT reports from the Pediatric 
      Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) TBI study. For that project,
      radiologists dictated CT reports as free text, which were then deidentified and
      scanned as PDF documents. Trained data abstractors manually coded each report for
      TBI outcome. Text was extracted from the PDF files using optical character
      recognition. The data set was randomly split evenly for training and testing.
      Training patient reports were used as input to the Medical Language Extraction
      and Encoding (MedLEE) NLP tool to create structured output containing
      standardized medical terms and modifiers for negation, certainty, and temporal
      status. A random subset stratified by site was analyzed using descriptive
      quantitative content analysis to confirm identification of TBI findings based on 
      the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Common Data
      Elements project. Findings were coded for presence or absence, weighted by
      frequency of mentions, and past/future/indication modifiers were filtered. After 
      combining with the manual reference standard, a decision tree classifier was
      created using data mining tools WEKA 3.7.5 and Salford Predictive Miner 7.0.
      Performance of the decision tree classifier was evaluated on the test patient
      reports. RESULTS: The prevalence of TBI in the sampled population was 159 of
      2,217 (7.2%). The automated classification for pediatric TBI is comparable to our
      prior results, with the notable exception of lower positive predictive value.
      Manual review of misclassified reports, 95.5% of which were false-positives,
      revealed that a sizable number of false-positive errors were due to differing
      outcome definitions between NINDS TBI findings and PECARN clinical important TBI 
      findings and report ambiguity not meeting definition criteria. CONCLUSIONS: A
      hybrid NLP and machine learning automated classification system continues to show
      promise in coding free-text electronic clinical data. For complex outcomes, it
      can reliably identify negative reports, but manual review of positive reports may
      be required. As such, it can still streamline data collection for clinical
      research and performance improvement.

TI  - NOBLE - Flexible concept recognition for large-scale biomedical natural language 
      processing.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/s12859-015-0871-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) applications are increasingly
      important in biomedical data analysis, knowledge engineering, and decision
      support. Concept recognition is an important component task for NLP pipelines,
      and can be either general-purpose or domain-specific. We describe a novel,
      flexible, and general-purpose concept recognition component for NLP pipelines,
      and compare its speed and accuracy against five commonly used alternatives on
      both a biological and clinical corpus. NOBLE Coder implements a general algorithm
      for matching terms to concepts from an arbitrary vocabulary set. The system's
      matching options can be configured individually or in combination to yield
      specific system behavior for a variety of NLP tasks. The software is open source,
      freely available, and easily integrated into UIMA or GATE. We benchmarked speed
      and accuracy of the system against the CRAFT and ShARe corpora as reference
      standards and compared it to MMTx, MGrep, Concept Mapper, cTAKES Dictionary
      Lookup Annotator, and cTAKES Fast Dictionary Lookup Annotator. RESULTS: We
      describe key advantages of the NOBLE Coder system and associated tools, including
      its greedy algorithm, configurable matching strategies, and multiple terminology 
      input formats. These features provide unique functionality when compared with
      existing alternatives, including state-of-the-art systems. On two benchmarking
      tasks, NOBLE's performance exceeded commonly used alternatives, performing almost
      as well as the most advanced systems. Error analysis revealed differences in
      error profiles among systems. CONCLUSION: NOBLE Coder is comparable to other
      widely used concept recognition systems in terms of accuracy and speed.
      Advantages of NOBLE Coder include its interactive terminology builder tool, ease 
      of configuration, and adaptability to various domains and tasks. NOBLE provides a
      term-to-concept matching system suitable for general concept recognition in
      biomedical NLP pipelines.

AB  - The migration of imaging reports to electronic medical record systems holds great
      potential in terms of advancing radiology research and practice by leveraging the
      large volume of data continuously being updated, integrated, and shared. However,
      there are significant challenges as well, largely due to the heterogeneity of how
      these data are formatted. Indeed, although there is movement toward structured
      reporting in radiology (ie, hierarchically itemized reporting with use of
      standardized terminology), the majority of radiology reports remain unstructured 
      and use free-form language. To effectively "mine" these large datasets for
      hypothesis testing, a robust strategy for extracting the necessary information is
      needed. Manual extraction of information is a time-consuming and often
      unmanageable task. "Intelligent" search engines that instead rely on natural
      language processing (NLP), a computer-based approach to analyzing free-form text 
      or speech, can be used to automate this data mining task. The overall goal of NLP
      is to translate natural human language into a structured format (ie, a fixed
      collection of elements), each with a standardized set of choices for its value,
      that is easily manipulated by computer programs to (among other things) order
      into subcategories or query for the presence or absence of a finding. The authors
      review the fundamentals of NLP and describe various techniques that constitute
      NLP in radiology, along with some key applications.

TI  - Pauses During Autobiographical Discourse Reflect Episodic Memory Processes in
      Early Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 687-98
LID - 10.3233/JAD-150408 [doi]
AB  - There is a large body of research on discourse production in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). Some studies have focused on pause production, revealing that patients make
      extensive use of pauses during speech. This has been attributed to lexical
      retrieval difficulties, but pausing may also reflect other forms of cognitive
      impairment as it increases with cognitive load. The aim of the present study was 
      to analyze autobiographical discourse impairment in AD from a broad perspective, 
      looking at pausing behavior (frequency, duration, and location). Our first
      objective was to characterize discourse changes in mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) due to AD. Our second objective was to determine the cognitive and
      neuroanatomical correlates of these changes. Fifteen patients with MCI due to AD 
      and 15 matched cognitively normal controls underwent an ecological episodic
      memory task, a full neuropsychological assessment, and a 3D T1-weighted MRI
      scans. Autobiographical discourse collected from the ecological episodic memory
      task was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, focusing on pausing. Intergroup
      comparisons showed that although patients did not produce more pauses than
      controls overall, they did make more between-utterance pauses. The number of
      these specific pauses was positively correlated with patients' episodic memory
      performance. Furthermore, neuroimaging analysis showed that, in the patient
      group, their use was negatively correlated with frontopolar area (BA 10) grey
      matter density. This region may therefore play an important role in the planning 
      of autobiographical discourse production. These findings demonstrate that pauses 
      in early AD may reflect a compensatory mechanism for improving mental time travel
      and memory retrieval.

TI  - Social Media Mining for Toxicovigilance: Automatic Monitoring of Prescription
      Medication Abuse from Twitter.
PG  - 231-40
LID - 10.1007/s40264-015-0379-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prescription medication overdose is the fastest growing
      drug-related problem in the USA. The growing nature of this problem necessitates 
      the implementation of improved monitoring strategies for investigating the
      prevalence and patterns of abuse of specific medications. OBJECTIVES: Our primary
      aims were to assess the possibility of utilizing social media as a resource for
      automatic monitoring of prescription medication abuse and to devise an automatic 
      classification technique that can identify potentially abuse-indicating user
      posts. METHODS: We collected Twitter user posts (tweets) associated with three
      commonly abused medications (Adderall((R)), oxycodone, and quetiapine). We
      manually annotated 6400 tweets mentioning these three medications and a control
      medication (metformin) that is not the subject of abuse due to its mechanism of
      action. We performed quantitative and qualitative analyses of the annotated data 
      to determine whether posts on Twitter contain signals of prescription medication 
      abuse. Finally, we designed an automatic supervised classification technique to
      distinguish posts containing signals of medication abuse from those that do not
      and assessed the utility of Twitter in investigating patterns of abuse over time.
      RESULTS: Our analyses show that clear signals of medication abuse can be drawn
      from Twitter posts and the percentage of tweets containing abuse signals are
      significantly higher for the three case medications (Adderall((R)): 23 %,
      quetiapine: 5.0 %, oxycodone: 12 %) than the proportion for the control
      medication (metformin: 0.3 %). Our automatic classification approach achieves 82 
      % accuracy overall (medication abuse class recall: 0.51, precision: 0.41, F
      measure: 0.46). To illustrate the utility of automatic classification, we show
      how the classification data can be used to analyze abuse patterns over time.
      CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that social media can be a crucial resource for
      obtaining abuse-related information for medications, and that automatic
      approaches involving supervised classification and natural language processing
      hold promises for essential future monitoring and intervention tasks.

PG  - 2182-2197
AB  - Finding an informative subset of a large collection of data points or models is
      at the center of many problems in computer vision, recommender systems,
      bio/health informatics as well as image and natural language processing. Given
      pairwise dissimilarities between the elements of a 'source set' and a 'target
      set,' we consider the problem of finding a subset of the source set, called
      representatives or exemplars, that can efficiently describe the target set. We
      formulate the problem as a row-sparsity regularized trace minimization problem.
      Since the proposed formulation is, in general, NP-hard, we consider a convex
      relaxation. The solution of our optimization finds representatives and the
      assignment of each element of the target set to each representative, hence,
      obtaining a clustering. We analyze the solution of our proposed optimization as a
      function of the regularization parameter. We show that when the two sets jointly 
      partition into multiple groups, our algorithm finds representatives from all
      groups and reveals clustering of the sets. In addition, we show that the proposed
      framework can effectively deal with outliers. Our algorithm works with arbitrary 
      dissimilarities, which can be asymmetric or violate the triangle inequality. To
      efficiently implement our algorithm, we consider an Alternating Direction Method 
      of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, which results in quadratic complexity in the
      problem size. We show that the ADMM implementation allows to parallelize the
      algorithm, hence further reducing the computational time. Finally, by experiments
      on real-world datasets, we show that our proposed algorithm improves the state of
      the art on the two problems of scene categorization using representative images
      and time-series modeling and segmentation using representative models.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe how computer-assisted presentation of case data can lead
      experts to infer machine-implementable rules for case definition in electronic
      health records. As an illustration the technique has been applied to obtain a
      definition of acute liver dysfunction (ALD) in persons with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). METHODS: The technique consists of repeatedly sampling new batches
      of case candidates from an enriched pool of persons meeting presumed minimal
      inclusion criteria, classifying the candidates by a machine-implementable
      candidate rule and by a human expert, and then updating the rule so that it
      captures new distinctions introduced by the expert. Iteration continues until an 
      update results in an acceptably small number of changes to form a final case
      definition. RESULTS: The technique was applied to structured data and terms
      derived by natural language processing from text records in 29,336 adults with
      IBD. Over three rounds the technique led to rules with increasing predictive
      value, as the experts identified exceptions, and increasing sensitivity, as the
      experts identified missing inclusion criteria. In the final rule inclusion and
      exclusion terms were often keyed to an ALD onset date. When compared against
      clinical review in an independent test round, the derived final case definition
      had a sensitivity of 92% and a positive predictive value of 79%. CONCLUSION: An
      iterative technique of machine-supported expert review can yield a case
      definition that accommodates available data, incorporates pre-existing medical
      knowledge, is transparent and is open to continuous improvement. The expert
      updates to rules may be informative in themselves. In this limited setting, the
      final case definition for ALD performed better than previous, published attempts 
      using expert definitions.

TI  - Large-scale Analysis of Counseling Conversations: An Application of Natural
      Language Processing to Mental Health.
PG  - 463-476
AB  - Mental illness is one of the most pressing public health issues of our time.
      While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge
      about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to 
      lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations. In this
      paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study on the discourse of
      text-message-based counseling conversations. We develop a set of novel
      computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic
      aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Applying
      techniques such as sequence-based conversation models, language model
      comparisons, message clustering, and psycholinguistics-inspired word frequency
      analyses, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associated with
      better conversation outcomes.

TI  - simDEF: definition-based semantic similarity measure of gene ontology terms for
      functional similarity analysis of genes.
PG  - 1380-7
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv755 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Measures of protein functional similarity are essential tools for
      function prediction, evaluation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and other 
      applications. Several existing methods perform comparisons between proteins based
      on the semantic similarity of their GO terms; however, these measures are highly 
      sensitive to modifications in the topological structure of GO, tend to be focused
      on specific analytical tasks and concentrate on the GO terms themselves rather
      than considering their textual definitions. RESULTS: We introduce simDEF, an
      efficient method for measuring semantic similarity of GO terms using their GO
      definitions, which is based on the Gloss Vector measure commonly used in natural 
      language processing. The simDEF approach builds optimized definition vectors for 
      all relevant GO terms, and expresses the similarity of a pair of proteins as the 
      cosine of the angle between their definition vectors. Relative to existing
      similarity measures, when validated on a yeast reference database, simDEF
      improves correlation with sequence homology by up to 50%, shows a correlation
      improvement >4% with gene expression in the biological process hierarchy of GO
      and increases PPI predictability by > 2.5% in F1 score for molecular function
      hierarchy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Datasets, results and source code are
      available at http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/simDEF CONTACT: ahmad.pgh@dal.ca or
      beiko@cs.dal.ca SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at

TI  - Dead Lactobacillus plantarum Stimulates and Skews Immune Responses toward T
      helper 1 and 17 Polarizations in RAW 264.7 Cells and Mouse Splenocytes.
PG  - 469-76
LID - 10.4014/jmb.1511.11001 [doi]
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of dead
      nano-sized Lactobacillus plantarum (nLp) in RAW 264.7 cells and murine primary
      splenocytes. nLp is a dead, shrunken, processed form of L. plantarum nF1 isolated
      from kimchi (a traditional Korean fermented cabbage) and is less than 1 mum in
      size. It was found that nLp treatment stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production
      more in RAW 264.7 macrophages than pure live L. plantarum (pLp), and that the
      stimulatory properties were probably largely derived from its cell wall. In
      addition, nLp induced murine splenocyte proliferation more so than pLp; in
      particular, a high dose of nLp (1.0 X 10(11) CFU/ml) stimulated proliferation as 
      much as lipopolysaccharide at 2 mug/ml. Moreover, according to our cytokine
      profile results in splenocytes, nLp treatment promoted Th1 (TNF-alpha, IL-12 p70)
      responses rather than Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) responses and also increased Th17 (IL-6,
      IL-17A) responses. Thus, nLp stimulated NO release in RAW 264.7 cells and induced
      splenocyte proliferation more so than pLp and stimulated Th1 and Th17 cytokine
      production. These findings suggested that dead nLp has potential use as a
      functional food ingredient to improve the immune response, and especially as a
      means of inducing Th1/Th17 immune responses.

TI  - Bad News: Analysis of the Quality of Information on Influenza Prevention Returned
      by Google in English and Italian.
PG  - 616
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2015.00616 [doi]
AB  - Information available to the public influences the approach of the population
      toward vaccination against influenza compared with other preventative approaches.
      In this study, we have analyzed the first 200 websites returned by searching
      Google on two topics (prevention of influenza and influenza vaccine), in English 
      and Italian. For all the four searches above, websites were classified according 
      to their typology (government, commercial, professional, portals, etc.) and for
      their trustworthiness as defined by the Journal of the American Medical
      Association (JAMA) score, which assesses whether they provide some basic elements
      of information quality (IQ): authorship, currency, disclosure, and references.
      The type of information described was also assessed to add another dimension of
      IQ. Websites on influenza prevention were classified according to the type of
      preventative approach mentioned (vaccine, lifestyle, hygiene, complementary
      medicine, etc.), whether the approaches were in agreement with evidence-based
      medicine (EBM) or not. Websites on influenza vaccination were classified as pro- 
      or anti-vaccine, or neutral. The great majority of websites described EBM
      approaches to influenza prevention and had a pro-vaccine orientation. Government 
      websites mainly pointed at EBM preventative approaches and had a pro-vaccine
      orientation, while there was a higher proportion of commercial websites among
      those which promote non-EBM approaches. Although the JAMA score was lower in
      commercial websites, it did not correlate with the preventative approaches
      suggested or the orientation toward vaccines. For each of the four search engine 
      result pages (SERP), only one website displayed the health-of-the-net (HON) seal.
      In the SERP on vaccines, journalistic websites were the most abundant category
      and ranked higher than average in both languages. Analysis using natural language
      processing showed that journalistic websites were mostly reporting news about two
      specific topics (different in the two languages). While the ranking by Google
      favors EBM approaches and, in English, does not promote commercial websites, in
      both languages it gives a great advantage to news. Thus, the type of news
      published during the influenza season probably has a key importance in orienting 
      the public opinion due to its high visibility. This raises important questions on
      the relationships between health IQ, trustworthiness, and newsworthiness.

LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1973 [doi]
AB  - Advances in cancer research and personalized medicine will require significant
      new bridging infrastructures, including more robust biorepositories that link
      human tissue to clinical phenotypes and outcomes. In order to meet that
      challenge, four cancer centers formed the Text Information Extraction System
      (TIES) Cancer Research Network, a federated network that facilitates data and
      biospecimen sharing among member institutions. Member sites can access pathology 
      data that are de-identified and processed with the TIES natural language
      processing system, which creates a repository of rich phenotype data linked to
      clinical biospecimens. TIES incorporates multiple security and privacy best
      practices that, combined with legal agreements, network policies, and procedures,
      enable regulatory compliance. The TIES Cancer Research Network now provides
      integrated access to investigators at all member institutions, where multiple
      investigator-driven pilot projects are underway. Examples of federated search
      across the network illustrate the potential impact on translational research,
      particularly for studies involving rare cancers, rare phenotypes, and specific
      biologic behaviors. The network satisfies several key desiderata including local 
      control of data and credentialing, inclusion of rich phenotype information, and
      applicability to diverse research objectives. The TIES Cancer Research Network
      presents a model for a national data and biospecimen network.

TI  - Nanoparticle siRNA against BMI-1 with a Polyethylenimine-Laminarin Conjugate for 
      Gene Therapy in Human Breast Cancer.
PG  - 66-73
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00650 [doi]
AB  - The B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus inset site 1 gene (BMI-1) has
      attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its key role in
      breast cancer development and metastasis. The downregulation of BMI-1 expression 
      via small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively inhibits tumor growth. However, the
      successful application of this therapy is limited by the unavailability of an
      appropriate vector for siRNA transfer. Therefore, this study aimed to construct a
      novel laminarin-based nonviral gene transfer vector to carry a constructed
      BMI-1-targeting siRNA and to investigate the in vitro and in vivo antitumor
      effects of this siRNA on breast cancer cells. To enhance the siRNA-carrying
      capacity, we introduced polyethylenimine (PEI) to laminarin's surface via
      N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, which produced the cationic PEI-modified laminarin
      conjugate nLP. Subsequent in vitro experiments indicated that nLP not only formed
      a nanoparticle with a diameter of 200 nm through electrostatic interactions with 
      siRNA but also showed high efficiency (95.0%) in the delivery siRNA to MCF-7
      cells. The nanoparticle targeting BMI-1 (nLP/siBMI-2) reduced BMI-1 expression in
      breast MCF-7 cells by 90.9% reduction. An in vivo tumor suppression experiment
      demonstrated that the nLP/siBMI-2 nanoparticle had relatively low toxicity and
      good gene-therapeutic efficacy, with a tumor inhibition rate of 46.6%.

TI  - Wide-Field Landers Temporary Keratoprosthesis in Severe Ocular Trauma: Functional
      and Anatomical Results after One Year.
PG  - 163675
LID - 10.1155/2015/163675 [doi]
AB  - Purpose. To evaluate longitudinal functional and anatomical results after
      combined pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) using a
      wide-field Landers intraoperative temporary keratoprosthesis (TKP) in patients
      with vitreoretinal pathology and corneal opacity due to severe ocular trauma.
      Material and Methods. Medical records of 12 patients who had undergone PPV/PKP/KP
      due to severe eye trauma were analyzed. Functional (best-corrected visual acuity)
      and anatomic outcomes (clarity of the corneal graft, retinal attachment, and
      intraocular pressure) were assessed during the follow-up (mean 16 months).
      Results. Final visual acuities varied from NLP to CF to 2 m. Visual acuity
      improved in 7 cases, was unchanged in 4 eyes, and worsened in 1 eye. The corneal 
      graft was transparent during the follow-up in 3 cases and graft failure was
      observed in 9 eyes. Silicone oil was used as a tamponade in all cases and retina 
      was reattached in 92% of cases. Conclusions. Combined PPV and PKP with the use of
      wide-field Landers TKP allowed for surgical intervention in patients with
      vitreoretinal pathology coexisting with corneal wound. Although retina was
      attached in most of the cases, corneal graft survived only in one-fourth of
      patients and final visual acuities were poor.

TI  - Semantic mapping reveals distinct patterns in descriptions of social relations in
      adults with autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 846-53
LID - 10.1002/aur.1581 [doi]
AB  - Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may describe other individuals
      differently compared with typical adults. In this study, we first asked
      participants to describe closely related individuals such as parents and close
      friends with 10 positive and 10 negative characteristics. We then used standard
      natural language processing methods to digitize and visualize these descriptions.
      The complex patterns of these descriptive sentences exhibited a difference in
      semantic space between individuals with ASD and control participants. Machine
      learning algorithms were able to automatically detect and discriminate between
      these two groups. Furthermore, we showed that these descriptive sentences from
      adults with ASD exhibited fewer connections as defined by word-word
      co-occurrences in descriptions, and these connections in words formed a less
      "small-world" like network. Autism Res 2016, 9: 846-853. (c) 2015 International

TI  - Evidence-based Neuro Linguistic Psychotherapy: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 355-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) Framework has enjoyed enormous
      popularity in the field of applied psychology. NLP has been used in business,
      education, law, medicine and psychotherapy to identify people's patterns and
      alter their responses to stimuli, so they are better able to regulate their
      environment and themselves. NLP looks at achieving goals, creating stable
      relationships, eliminating barriers such as fears and phobias, building
      self-confidence, and self-esteem, and achieving peak performance. Neuro
      Linguistic Psychotherapy (NLPt) encompasses NLP as framework and set of
      interventions in the treatment of individuals with different psychological and/or
      social problems. We aimed systematically to analyse the available data regarding 
      the effectiveness of Neuro Linguistic Psychotherapy (NLPt). SUBJECTS AND METHODS:
      The present work is a meta-analysis of studies, observational or randomized
      controlled trials, for evaluating the efficacy of Neuro Linguistic Programming in
      individuals with different psychological and/or social problems. The databases
      searched to identify studies in English and German language: CENTRAL in the
      Cochrane Library; PubMed; ISI Web of Knowledge (include results also from Medline
      and the Web of Science); PsycINFO (including PsycARTICLES); Psyndex;
      Deutschsprachige Diplomarbeiten der Psychologie (database of theses in Psychology
      in German language), Social SciSearch; National library of health and two
      NLP-specific research databases: one from the NLP Community
      (http://www.nlp.de/cgi-bin/research/nlprdb.cgi?action=res_entries) and one from
      the NLP Group
      (http://www.nlpgrup.com/bilimselarastirmalar/bilimsel-arastirmalar-4.html#Zweig15
      4). RESULTS: From a total number of 425 studies, 350 were removed and considered 
      not relevant based on the title and abstract. Included, in the final analysis,
      are 12 studies with numbers of participants ranging between 12 and 115 subjects. 
      The vast majority of studies were prospective observational. The actual paper
      represents the first meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of NLP therapy
      for individuals with social/psychological problems. The overall meta-analysis
      found that the NLP therapy may add an overall standardized mean difference of
      0.54 with a confidence interval of CI=[0.20; 0.88]. CONCLUSION: Neuro-Linguistic 
      Psychotherapy as a psychotherapeutic modality grounded in theoretical frameworks,
      methodologies and interventions scientifically developed, including models
      developed by NLP, shows results that can hold its ground in comparison with other
      psychotherapeutic methods.

TI  - EHR based Genetic Testing Knowledge Base (iGTKB) Development.
PG  - S3
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-15-S4-S3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gap between a large growing number of genetic tests and a
      suboptimal clinical workflow of incorporating these tests into regular clinical
      practice poses barriers to effective reliance on advanced genetic technologies to
      improve quality of healthcare. A promising solution to fill this gap is to
      develop an intelligent genetic test recommendation system that not only can
      provide a comprehensive view of genetic tests as education resources, but also
      can recommend the most appropriate genetic tests to patients based on clinical
      evidence. In this study, we developed an EHR based Genetic Testing Knowledge Base
      for Individualized Medicine (iGTKB). METHODS: We extracted genetic testing
      information and patient medical records from EHR systems at Mayo Clinic. Clinical
      features have been semi-automatically annotated from the clinical notes by
      applying a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool, MedTagger suite. To prioritize
      clinical features for each genetic test, we compared odds ratio across four
      population groups. Genetic tests, genetic disorders and clinical features with
      their odds ratios have been applied to establish iGTKB, which is to be integrated
      into the Genetic Testing Ontology (GTO). RESULTS: Overall, there are five genetic
      tests operated with sample size greater than 100 in 2013 at Mayo Clinic. A total 
      of 1,450 patients who was tested by one of the five genetic tests have been
      selected. We assembled 243 clinical features from the Human Phenotype Ontology
      (HPO) for these five genetic tests. There are 60 clinical features with at least 
      one mention in clinical notes of patients taking the test. Twenty-eight clinical 
      features with high odds ratio (greater than 1) have been selected as dominant
      features and deposited into iGTKB with their associated information about genetic
      tests and genetic disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed an EHR
      based genetic testing knowledge base, iGTKB. iGTKB will be integrated into the
      GTO by providing relevant clinical evidence, and ultimately to support
      development of genetic testing recommendation system, iGenetics.

      Sodium-Induced Colon Cancer in Balb/c Mice.
PG  - 1400-5
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2015.3577 [doi]
AB  - The chemopreventive effects of dead nano-sized Lactobacillus plantarum (nLp) on
      colon carcinogenesis, induced by dextran sulfate sodium and azoxymethane, were
      evaluated using Balb/c mice and compared with the effects of pure live L.
      plantarum (pLp). nLp is a dead shrunken form of L. plantarum derived from kimchi 
      and has a particle size of 0.5-1.0 mum. Animals fed nLp showed less weight loss, 
      longer colons, lower colon weight/length ratios, and fewer colonic tumors
      compared with pLp. In addition, the administration of nLp significantly reduced
      the expression of inflammatory markers, mediated the expression of cell cycle and
      apoptotic markers in colon tissues, and elevated fecal IgA levels more than pLp. 
      Accordingly, the present study shows that the anticolorectal cancer activities of
      nLp are greater than those of pLp and suggests this is due to the suppression of 
      inflammation, the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and enhanced IgA 
      secretion.

TI  - An Overview of Biomolecular Event Extraction from Scientific Documents.
PG  - 571381
LID - 10.1155/2015/571381 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a review of state-of-the-art approaches to automatic
      extraction of biomolecular events from scientific texts. Events involving
      biomolecules such as genes, transcription factors, or enzymes, for example, have 
      a central role in biological processes and functions and provide valuable
      information for describing physiological and pathogenesis mechanisms. Event
      extraction from biomedical literature has a broad range of applications,
      including support for information retrieval, knowledge summarization, and
      information extraction and discovery. However, automatic event extraction is a
      challenging task due to the ambiguity and diversity of natural language and
      higher-level linguistic phenomena, such as speculations and negations, which
      occur in biological texts and can lead to misunderstanding or incorrect
      interpretation. Many strategies have been proposed in the last decade,
      originating from different research areas such as natural language processing,
      machine learning, and statistics. This review summarizes the most representative 
      approaches in biomolecular event extraction and presents an analysis of the
      current state of the art and of commonly used methods, features, and tools.
      Finally, current research trends and future perspectives are also discussed.

AB  - This editorial is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine
      on "Big Data and Analytics in Healthcare". The amount of data being generated in 
      the healthcare industry is growing at a rapid rate. This has generated immense
      interest in leveraging the availability of healthcare data (and "big data") to
      improve health outcomes and reduce costs. However, the nature of healthcare data,
      and especially big data, presents unique challenges in processing and analyzing
      big data in healthcare. This Focus Theme aims to disseminate some novel
      approaches to address these challenges. More specifically, approaches ranging
      from efficient methods of processing large clinical data to predictive models
      that could generate better predictions from healthcare data are presented.

TI  - Finding Text-Supported Gene-to-Disease Co-appearances with MOPED-Digger.
PG  - 754-6
LID - 10.1089/omi.2015.0151 [doi]
AB  - Gene/disease associations are a critical part of exploring disease causes and
      ultimately cures, yet the publications that might provide such information are
      too numerous to be manually reviewed. We present a software utility,
      MOPED-Digger, that enables focused human assessment of literature by applying
      natural language processing (NLP) to search for customized lists of genes and
      diseases in titles and abstracts from biomedical publications. The results are
      ranked lists of gene/disease co-appearances and the publications that support
      them. Analysis of 18,159,237 PubMed title/abstracts yielded 1,796,799
      gene/disease co-appearances that can be used to focus attention on the most
      promising publications for a possible gene/disease association. An integrated
      score is provided to enable assessment of broadly presented published evidence to
      capture more tenuous connections. MOPED-Digger is written in Java and uses Apache
      Lucene 5.0 library. The utility runs as a command-line program with a variety of 
      user-options and is freely available for download from the MOPED 3.0 website
      (moped.proteinspire.org).

LID - S0002-8177(15)00714-X [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality improvement requires using quality measures that can be
      implemented in a valid manner. Using guidelines set forth by the Meaningful Use
      portion of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
      Act, the authors assessed the feasibility and performance of an automated
      electronic Meaningful Use dental clinical quality measure to determine the
      percentage of children who received fluoride varnish. METHODS: The authors
      defined how to implement the automated measure queries in a dental electronic
      health record. Within records identified through automated query, the authors
      manually reviewed a subsample to assess the performance of the query. RESULTS:
      The automated query results revealed that 71.0% of patients had fluoride varnish 
      compared with the manual chart review results that indicated 77.6% of patients
      had fluoride varnish. The automated quality measure performance results indicated
      90.5% sensitivity, 90.8% specificity, 96.9% positive predictive value, and 75.2% 
      negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings support the
      feasibility of using automated dental quality measure queries in the context of
      sufficient structured data. Information noted only in free text rather than in
      structured data would require using natural language processing approaches to
      effectively query electronic health records. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: To
      participate in self-directed quality improvement, dental clinicians must embrace 
      the accountability era. Commitment to quality will require enhanced documentation
      to support near-term automated calculation of quality measures.

AB  - Self-reported patient data has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for
      post-market pharmacovigilance. In this paper we propose using the popular
      micro-blogging service Twitter to gather evidence about adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs) after firstly having identified micro-blog messages (also know as
      "tweets") that report first-hand experience. In order to achieve this goal we
      explore machine learning with data crowdsourced from laymen annotators. With the 
      help of lay annotators recruited from CrowdFlower we manually annotated 1548
      tweets containing keywords related to two kinds of drugs: SSRIs (eg. Paroxetine),
      and cognitive enhancers (eg. Ritalin). Our results show that inter-annotator
      agreement (Fleiss' kappa) for crowdsourcing ranks in moderate agreement with a
      pair of experienced annotators (Spearman's Rho=0.471). We utilized the gold
      standard annotations from CrowdFlower for automatically training a range of
      supervised machine learning models to recognize first-hand experience. F-Score
      values are reported for 6 of these techniques with the Bayesian Generalized
      Linear Model being the best (F-Score=0.64 and Informedness=0.43) when combined
      with a selected set of features obtained by using information gain criteria.

TI  - Trends in biomedical informatics: automated topic analysis of JAMIA articles.
PG  - 1153-63
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv157 [doi]
AB  - Biomedical Informatics is a growing interdisciplinary field in which research
      topics and citation trends have been evolving rapidly in recent years. To analyze
      these data in a fast, reproducible manner, automation of certain processes is
      needed. JAMIA is a "generalist" journal for biomedical informatics. Its articles 
      reflect the wide range of topics in informatics. In this study, we retrieved
      Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and citations of JAMIA articles published
      between 2009 and 2014. We use tensors (i.e., multidimensional arrays) to
      represent the interaction among topics, time and citations, and applied tensor
      decomposition to automate the analysis. The trends represented by tensors were
      then carefully interpreted and the results were compared with previous findings
      based on manual topic analysis. A list of most cited JAMIA articles, their
      topics, and publication trends over recent years is presented. The analyses
      confirmed previous studies and showed that, from 2012 to 2014, the number of
      articles related to MeSH terms Methods, Organization & Administration, and
      Algorithms increased significantly both in number of publications and citations. 
      Citation trends varied widely by topic, with Natural Language Processing having a
      large number of citations in particular years, and Medical Record Systems,
      Computerized remaining a very popular topic in all years.

TI  - Sieve-based relation extraction of gene regulatory networks from biological
      literature.
PG  - S1
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S16-S1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Relation extraction is an essential procedure in literature mining.
      It focuses on extracting semantic relations between parts of text, called
      mentions. Biomedical literature includes an enormous amount of textual
      descriptions of biological entities, their interactions and results of related
      experiments. To extract them in an explicit, computer readable format, these
      relations were at first extracted manually from databases. Manual curation was
      later replaced with automatic or semi-automatic tools with natural language
      processing capabilities. The current challenge is the development of information 
      extraction procedures that can directly infer more complex relational structures,
      such as gene regulatory networks. RESULTS: We develop a computational approach
      for extraction of gene regulatory networks from textual data. Our method is
      designed as a sieve-based system and uses linear-chain conditional random fields 
      and rules for relation extraction. With this method we successfully extracted the
      sporulation gene regulation network in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis for the
      information extraction challenge at the BioNLP 2013 conference. To enable
      extraction of distant relations using first-order models, we transform the data
      into skip-mention sequences. We infer multiple models, each of which is able to
      extract different relationship types. Following the shared task, we conducted
      additional analysis using different system settings that resulted in reducing the
      reconstruction error of bacterial sporulation network from 0.73 to 0.68, measured
      as the slot error rate between the predicted and the reference network. We
      observe that all relation extraction sieves contribute to the predictive
      performance of the proposed approach. Also, features constructed by considering
      mention words and their prefixes and suffixes are the most important features for
      higher accuracy of extraction. Analysis of distances between different mention
      types in the text shows that our choice of transforming data into skip-mention
      sequences is appropriate for detecting relations between distant mentions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Linear-chain conditional random fields, along with appropriate data 
      transformations, can be efficiently used to extract relations. The sieve-based
      architecture simplifies the system as new sieves can be easily added or removed
      and each sieve can utilize the results of previous ones. Furthermore, sieves with
      conditional random fields can be trained on arbitrary text data and hence are
      applicable to broad range of relation extraction tasks and data domains.

TI  - Using Twitter Data to Gain Insights into E-cigarette Marketing and Locations of
      Use: An Infoveillance Study.
PG  - e251
LID - 10.2196/jmir.4466 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Marketing and use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other
      electronic nicotine delivery devices have increased exponentially in recent years
      fueled, in part, by marketing and word-of-mouth communications via social media
      platforms, such as Twitter. OBJECTIVE: This study examines Twitter posts about
      e-cigarettes between 2008 and 2013 to gain insights into (1) marketing trends for
      selling and promoting e-cigarettes and (2) locations where people use
      e-cigarettes. METHODS: We used keywords to gather tweets about e-cigarettes
      between July 1, 2008 and February 28, 2013. A randomly selected subset of tweets 
      was manually coded as advertising (eg, marketing, advertising, sales, promotion) 
      or nonadvertising (eg, individual users, consumers), and classification
      algorithms were trained to code the remaining data into these 2 categories. A
      combination of manual coding and natural language processing methods was used to 
      indicate locations where people used e-cigarettes. Additional metadata were used 
      to generate insights about users who tweeted most frequently about e-cigarettes. 
      RESULTS: We identified approximately 1.7 million tweets about e-cigarettes
      between 2008 and 2013, with the majority of these tweets being advertising
      (93.43%, 1,559,508/1,669,123). Tweets about e-cigarettes increased more than
      tenfold between 2009 and 2010, suggesting a rapid increase in the popularity of
      e-cigarettes and marketing efforts. The Twitter handles tweeting most frequently 
      about e-cigarettes were a mixture of e-cigarette brands, affiliate marketers, and
      resellers of e-cigarette products. Of the 471 e-cigarette tweets mentioning a
      specific place, most mentioned e-cigarette use in class (39.1%, 184/471) followed
      by home/room/bed (12.5%, 59/471), school (12.1%, 57/471), in public (8.7%,
      41/471), the bathroom (5.7%, 27/471), and at work (4.5%, 21/471). CONCLUSIONS:
      Twitter is being used to promote e-cigarettes by different types of entities and 
      the online marketplace is more diverse than offline product offerings and
      advertising strategies. E-cigarettes are also being used in public places, such
      as schools, underscoring the need for education and enforcement of policies
      banning e-cigarette use in public places. Twitter data can provide new insights
      on e-cigarettes to help inform future research, regulations, surveillance, and
      enforcement efforts.

TI  - Scaling-up NLP Pipelines to Process Large Corpora of Clinical Notes.
PG  - 548-52
LID - 10.3414/ME14-02-0018 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information
      in Medicine on "Big Data and Analytics in Healthcare". OBJECTIVES: This paper
      describes the scale-up efforts at the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System to
      address processing large corpora of clinical notes through a natural language
      processing (NLP) pipeline. The use case described is a current project focused on
      detecting the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter in hospitalized patients
      and subsequent catheter-associated urinary tract infections. METHODS: An NLP
      algorithm using v3NLP was developed to detect the presence of an indwelling
      urinary catheter in hospitalized patients. The algorithm was tested on a small
      corpus of notes on patients for whom the presence or absence of a catheter was
      already known (reference standard). In planning for a scale-up, we estimated that
      the original algorithm would have taken 2.4 days to run on a larger corpus of
      notes for this project (550,000 notes), and 27 days for a corpus of 6 million
      records representative of a national sample of notes. We approached scaling-up
      NLP pipelines through three techniques: pipeline replication via multi-threading,
      intra-annotator threading for tasks that can be further decomposed, and remote
      annotator services which enable annotator scale-out. RESULTS: The scale-up
      resulted in reducing the average time to process a record from 206 milliseconds
      to 17 milliseconds or a 12- fold increase in performance when applied to a corpus
      of 550,000 notes. CONCLUSIONS: Purposely simplistic in nature, these scale-up
      efforts are the straight forward evolution from small scale NLP processing to
      larger scale extraction without incurring associated complexities that are
      inherited by the use of the underlying UIMA framework. These efforts represent
      generalizable and widely applicable techniques that will aid other
      computationally complex NLP pipelines that are of need to be scaled out for
      processing and analyzing big data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Text pages can communicate important information but also disrupt
      workflow, which can affect the safety of patient care. The purpose of this study 
      was to analyze the content, volume, and distribution of text pages received by
      general surgery residents and physician's assistants (PAs) using natural language
      processing (NLP). METHODS: We studied text pages received by residents and PAs at
      a tertiary care teaching hospital from March to May 2012 using NLP. The number
      and content of pages were stratified by recipient seniority, surgical service,
      patient census, and patient location. Chi-square tests, t test, and analysis of
      variance were used to detect statistical significance. RESULTS: We captured
      48,202 pages. The average number (mean +/- standard deviation) of pages per hour 
      was 3.1 +/- 2.2 for postgraduate year (PGY)-1s and 2.8 +/- 1.9 for PAs (P <
      .0001). The greatest number of pages per day by Service was 86.1 +/- 37.5 on the 
      acute care surgery service. The most common paging topic was medications (18,444 
      [38.3%]) and the most common symptom was pain (6,240 pages [12.9%]). On services 
      where patients were located near each other (regionalized), the number of pages
      per day per recipient per patient on census was almost half that compared with
      nonregionalized services (1.40 vs 2.43; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Residents receive
      a high volume of pages at this tertiary care center, particularly regarding
      medications and pain. Services with regionalized patients exhibit less paging
      need per patient. Initiatives to improve pain management and regionalize patients
      may streamline communication, decrease the number of pages, and increase patient 
      safety.

      Text.
PG  - 300-9
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467531 [doi]
AB  - We present TimeLineCurator, a browser-based authoring tool that automatically
      extracts event data from temporal references in unstructured text documents using
      natural language processing and encodes them along a visual timeline. Our goal is
      to facilitate the timeline creation process for journalists and others who tell
      temporal stories online. Current solutions involve manually extracting and
      formatting event data from source documents, a process that tends to be tedious
      and error prone. With TimeLineCurator, a prospective timeline author can quickly 
      identify the extent of time encompassed by a document, as well as the
      distribution of events occurring along this timeline. Authors can speculatively
      browse possible documents to quickly determine whether they are appropriate
      sources of timeline material. TimeLineCurator provides controls for curating and 
      editing events on a timeline, the ability to combine timelines from multiple
      source documents, and export curated timelines for online deployment. We evaluate
      TimeLineCurator through a benchmark comparison of entity extraction error against
      a manual timeline curation process, a preliminary evaluation of the user
      experience of timeline authoring, a brief qualitative analysis of its visual
      output, and a discussion of prospective use cases suggested by members of the
      target author communities following its deployment.

AB  - Informatics methods, such as text mining and natural language processing, are
      always involved in bioinformatics research. In this study, we discuss text mining
      and natural language processing methods in bioinformatics from two perspectives. 
      First, we aim to search for knowledge on biology, retrieve references using text 
      mining methods, and reconstruct databases. For example, protein-protein
      interactions and gene-disease relationship can be mined from PubMed. Then, we
      analyze the applications of text mining and natural language processing
      techniques in bioinformatics, including predicting protein structure and
      function, detecting noncoding RNA. Finally, numerous methods and applications, as
      well as their contributions to bioinformatics, are discussed for future use by
      text mining and natural language processing researchers.

TI  - Predicting High Imaging Utilization Based on Initial Radiology Reports: A
      Feasibility Study of Machine Learning.

LID - 10.1016/j.acra.2015.09.014 [doi]

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Imaging utilization has significantly increased over
      the last two decades, and is only recently showing signs of moderating. To help
      healthcare providers identify patients at risk for high imaging utilization, we
      developed a prediction model to recognize high imaging utilizers based on their
      initial imaging reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prediction model uses a
      machine learning text classification framework. In this study, we used radiology 
      reports from 18,384 patients with at least one abdomen computed tomography study 
      in their imaging record at Stanford Health Care as the training set. We modeled
      the radiology reports in a vector space and trained a support vector machine
      classifier for this prediction task. We evaluated our model on a separate test
      set of 4791 patients. In addition to high prediction accuracy, in our method, we 
      aimed at achieving high specificity to identify patients at high risk for high
      imaging utilization. RESULTS: Our results (accuracy: 94.0%, sensitivity: 74.4%,
      specificity: 97.9%, positive predictive value: 87.3%, negative predictive value: 
      95.1%) show that a prediction model can enable healthcare providers to identify
      in advance patients who are likely to be high utilizers of imaging services.
      CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning classifiers developed from narrative radiology
      reports are feasible methods to predict imaging utilization. Such systems can be 
      used to identify high utilizers, inform future image ordering behavior, and
      encourage judicious use of imaging.

TI  - Multilayered temporal modeling for the clinical domain.
PG  - 387-95
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv113 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an open-source temporal relation discovery system for the
      clinical domain. The system is capable of automatically inferring temporal
      relations between events and time expressions using a multilayered modeling
      strategy. It can operate at different levels of granularity--from rough
      temporality expressed as event relations to the document creation time (DCT) to
      temporal containment to fine-grained classic Allen-style relations. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We evaluated our systems on 2 clinical corpora. One is a subset of the
      Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME) corpus, which was used in
      SemEval 2015 Task 6: Clinical TempEval. The other is the 2012 Informatics for
      Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) challenge corpus. We designed multiple
      supervised machine learning models to compute the DCT relation and
      within-sentence temporal relations. For the i2b2 data, we also developed models
      and rule-based methods to recognize cross-sentence temporal relations. We used
      the official evaluation scripts of both challenges to make our results comparable
      with results of other participating systems. In addition, we conducted a feature 
      ablation study to find out the contribution of various features to the system's
      performance. RESULTS: Our system achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
      Clinical TempEval corpus and was on par with the best systems on the i2b2 2012
      corpus. Particularly, on the Clinical TempEval corpus, our system established a
      new F1 score benchmark, statistically significant as compared to the baseline and
      the best participating system. CONCLUSION: Presented here is the first
      open-source clinical temporal relation discovery system. It was built using a
      multilayered temporal modeling strategy and achieved top performance in 2 major
      shared tasks.

AB  - Social media offer insights of patients' medical problems such as drug side
      effects and treatment failures. Patient reports of adverse drug events from
      social media have great potential to improve current practice of
      pharmacovigilance. However, extracting patient adverse drug event reports from
      social media continues to be an important challenge for health informatics
      research. In this study, we develop a research framework with advanced natural
      language processing techniques for integrated and high-performance patient
      reported adverse drug event extraction. The framework consists of medical entity 
      extraction for recognizing patient discussions of drug and events, adverse drug
      event extraction with shortest dependency path kernel based statistical learning 
      method and semantic filtering with information from medical knowledge bases, and 
      report source classification to tease out noise. To evaluate the proposed
      framework, a series of experiments were conducted on a test bed encompassing
      about postings from major diabetes and heart disease forums in the United States.
      The results reveal that each component of the framework significantly contributes
      to its overall effectiveness. Our framework significantly outperforms prior work.

TI  - Identification of subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome using electronic health
      records.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s12958-015-0115-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder because 
      of the variable criteria used for diagnosis. Therefore, International
      Classification of Diseases 9 (ICD-9) codes may not accurately capture the
      diagnostic criteria necessary for large scale PCOS identification. We
      hypothesized that use of electronic medical records text and data would more
      specifically capture PCOS subjects. METHODS: Subjects with PCOS were identified
      in the Partners Healthcare Research Patients Data Registry by searching for the
      term "polycystic ovary syndrome" using natural language processing (n = 24,930). 
      A training subset of 199 identified charts was reviewed and categorized based on 
      likelihood of a true Rotterdam PCOS diagnosis, i.e. two out of three of the
      following: irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism and/or polycystic ovary
      morphology. Data from the history, physical exam, laboratory and radiology
      results were codified and extracted from notes of definite PCOS subjects.
      Thirty-two terms were used to build an algorithm for identifying definite PCOS
      cases and applied to the rest of the dataset. The positive predictive value
      cutoff was set at 76.8 % to maximize the number of subjects available for study. 
      A true positive predictive value for the algorithm was calculated after review of
      100 charts from subjects identified as definite PCOS cases with at least two
      documented Rotterdam criteria. The positive predictive value was compared to that
      calculated using 200 charts identified using the ICD-9 code for PCOS (256.4; n = 
      13,670). In addition, a cohort of previously recruited PCOS subjects was
      submitted for algorithm validation. RESULTS: Chart review demonstrated that 64 % 
      were confirmed as definitely PCOS using the algorithm, with a 9 % false positive 
      rate. 66 % of subjects identified by ICD-9 code for PCOS could be confirmed as
      definitely PCOS, with an 8.5 % false positive rate. There was no significant
      difference in the positive predictive values using the two methods (p = 0.2).
      However, the number of charts that had insufficient confirmatory data was lower
      using the algorithm (5 % vs 11 %; p < 0.04). Of 477 subjects with PCOS recruited 
      and examined individually and present in the database as patients, 451 were found
      within the algorithm dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Extraction of text parameters along
      with codified data improves the confidence in PCOS patient cohorts identified
      using the electronic medical record. However, the positive predictive value was
      not significantly different when using ICD-9 codes or the specific algorithm.
      Further studies are needed to determine the positive predictive value of the two 
      methods in additional electronic medical record datasets.

TI  - Automatic extraction of reference gene from literature in plants based on texting
      mining.
PG  - 400-16
AB  - Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used in
      biological research. It is a key to the availability of qRT-PCR experiment to
      select a stable reference gene. However, selecting an appropriate reference gene 
      usually requires strict biological experiment for verification with high cost in 
      the process of selection. Scientific literatures have accumulated a lot of
      achievements on the selection of reference gene. Therefore, mining reference
      genes under specific experiment environments from literatures can provide quite
      reliable reference genes for similar qRT-PCR experiments with the advantages of
      reliability, economic and efficiency. An auxiliary reference gene discovery
      method from literature is proposed in this paper which integrated machine
      learning, natural language processing and text mining approaches. The validity
      tests showed that this new method has a better precision and recall on the
      extraction of reference genes and their environments.

TI  - Development and Implementation of a New Physical Training Concept in the
      Norwegian Navy Special Operations Command.
PG  - S204-10
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0000000000001085 [doi]
AB  - A high level of physical fitness is one important factor for optimal performance 
      in Special Operation Forces (SOF). Still, information about physical training for
      SOF operators is not easily accessible. This study aimed to implement and assess 
      a new training concept in the Norwegian Navy SOF. A longitudinal study where 22
      operators completed a 6-month linear periodization (LP), followed by a 6-month
      nonlinear periodization (NLP) program. Both protocols were block periodized,
      focusing on either strength or aerobic capacity. A battery of tests covering
      strength, endurance, power, mobility, and body composition was performed, and
      individual capacity analyses were established. A training week consisted of 5 to 
      6 sessions including 1 or 2 individualized sessions directed towards improving
      the weakest capacity. The LP had a clear effect on mobility (19 +/- 9%),
      abdominal strength (25 +/- 16%), upper body power (PowerUB; 6 +/- 9%), standing
      long-jump (3 +/- 6%), pull-ups (24 +/- 31%), agility (2 +/- 4%), V[Combining Dot 
      Above]O2max (2 +/- 3%), fat percent (-5 +/- 31%), and muscle mass (1 +/- 3%). The
      NLP increased abdominal strength (15 +/- 17%), standing long-jump (3 +/- 4%), and
      anaerobic capacity (10 +/- 8%), whereas V[Combining Dot Above]O2 max (-3 +/- 4%) 
      and PowerUB (-2 +/- 7%) decreased. Additional analyses showed clear increases
      among those individually instructed to improve strength. Results support the
      benefits of combined periodized programming and individualized training sessions 
      among SOF operators with initially good fitness levels. Largest effects were
      observed in the first phase with the LP. However, subsequent NLP additionally
      increased anaerobic and jumping capacity, possibly due to more frequent muscular 
      endurance and power training. Because of frequent interruptions, the LP tended to
      be more difficult to follow than the NLP and is suggested when continuity is
      possible, whereas an NLP is recommended for maintenance and when standing on
      national preparedness.

AB  - Citations to previous literature are extensively used to measure the quality and 
      diffusion of knowledge. However, we know little about the different ways in which
      a study can be cited; in particular, are papers cited to point out their merits
      or their flaws? We elaborated a methodology to characterize "negative" citations 
      using bibliometric data and natural language processing. We found that negative
      citations concerned higher-quality papers, were focused on a study's findings
      rather than theories or methods, and originated from scholars who were closer to 
      the authors of the focal paper in terms of discipline and social distance, but
      not geographically. Receiving a negative citation was also associated with a
      slightly faster decline in citations to the paper in the long run.

TI  - Personalized and automated remote monitoring of atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 347-52
LID - 10.1093/europace/euv234 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices is a growing
      standard; yet, remote follow-up and management of alerts represents a
      time-consuming task for physicians or trained staff. This study evaluates an
      automatic mechanism based on artificial intelligence tools to filter atrial
      fibrillation (AF) alerts based on their medical significance. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We evaluated this method on alerts for AF episodes that occurred in 60
      pacemaker recipients. AKENATON prototype workflow includes two steps: natural
      language-processing algorithms abstract the patient health record to a digital
      version, then a knowledge-based algorithm based on an applied formal ontology
      allows to calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score and evaluate the anticoagulation
      status of the patient. Each alert is then automatically classified by importance 
      from low to critical, by mimicking medical reasoning. Final classification was
      compared with human expert analysis by two physicians. A total of 1783 alerts
      about AF episode >5 min in 60 patients were processed. A 1749 of 1783 alerts
      (98%) were adequately classified and there were no underestimation of alert
      importance in the remaining 34 misclassified alerts. CONCLUSION: This work
      demonstrates the ability of a pilot system to classify alerts and improves
      personalized remote monitoring of patients. In particular, our method allows
      integration of patient medical history with device alert notifications, which is 
      useful both from medical and resource-management perspectives. The system was
      able to automatically classify the importance of 1783 AF alerts in 60 patients,
      which resulted in an 84% reduction in notification workload, while preserving
      patient safety.

LID - 10.1093/nar/gkv1075 [doi]
AB  - Unwanted side effects of drugs are a burden on patients and a severe impediment
      in the development of new drugs. At the same time, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
      recorded during clinical trials are an important source of human phenotypic data.
      It is therefore essential to combine data on drugs, targets and side effects into
      a more complete picture of the therapeutic mechanism of actions of drugs and the 
      ways in which they cause adverse reactions. To this end, we have created the
      SIDER ('Side Effect Resource', http://sideeffects.embl.de) database of drugs and 
      ADRs. The current release, SIDER 4, contains data on 1430 drugs, 5880 ADRs and
      140 064 drug-ADR pairs, which is an increase of 40% compared to the previous
      version. For more fine-grained analyses, we extracted the frequency with which
      side effects occur from the package inserts. This information is available for
      39% of drug-ADR pairs, 19% of which can be compared to the frequency under
      placebo treatment. SIDER furthermore contains a data set of drug indications,
      extracted from the package inserts using Natural Language Processing. These drug 
      indications are used to reduce the rate of false positives by identifying medical
      terms that do not correspond to ADRs.

TI  - Information extraction from multi-institutional radiology reports.
PG  - 29-39

LID - S0933-3657(15)00124-4 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The radiology report is the most important source of clinical imaging
      information. It documents critical information about the patient's health and the
      radiologist's interpretation of medical findings. It also communicates
      information to the referring physicians and records that information for future
      clinical and research use. Although efforts to structure some radiology report
      information through predefined templates are beginning to bear fruit, a large
      portion of radiology report information is entered in free text. The free text
      format is a major obstacle for rapid extraction and subsequent use of information
      by clinicians, researchers, and healthcare information systems. This difficulty
      is due to the ambiguity and subtlety of natural language, complexity of described
      images, and variations among different radiologists and healthcare organizations.
      As a result, radiology reports are used only once by the clinician who ordered
      the study and rarely are used again for research and data mining. In this work,
      machine learning techniques and a large multi-institutional radiology report
      repository are used to extract the semantics of the radiology report and overcome
      the barriers to the re-use of radiology report information in clinical research
      and other healthcare applications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe a machine
      learning system to annotate radiology reports and extract report contents
      according to an information model. This information model covers the majority of 
      clinically significant contents in radiology reports and is applicable to a wide 
      variety of radiology study types. Our automated approach uses discriminative
      sequence classifiers for named-entity recognition to extract and organize
      clinically significant terms and phrases consistent with the information model.
      We evaluated our information extraction system on 150 radiology reports from
      three major healthcare organizations and compared its results to a commonly used 
      non-machine learning information extraction method. We also evaluated the
      generalizability of our approach across different organizations by training and
      testing our system on data from different organizations. RESULTS: Our results
      show the efficacy of our machine learning approach in extracting the information 
      model's elements (10-fold cross-validation average performance: precision: 87%,
      recall: 84%, F1 score: 85%) and its superiority and generalizability compared to 
      the common non-machine learning approach (p-value<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our machine
      learning information extraction approach provides an effective automatic method
      to annotate and extract clinically significant information from a large
      collection of free text radiology reports. This information extraction system can
      help clinicians better understand the radiology reports and prioritize their
      review process. In addition, the extracted information can be used by researchers
      to link radiology reports to information from other data sources such as
      electronic health records and the patient's genome. Extracted information also
      can facilitate disease surveillance, real-time clinical decision support for the 
      radiologist, and content-based image retrieval.

      all-normal-dispersion Yb-doped fiber laser. We show that Raman scattering can be

      polarization control, the Raman effect can be utilized to generate broadband
      noise-like pulses (NLPs) with bandwidth up to 61.4 nm. To the best of our
      knowledge, this is the broadest NLP achieved in all-normal-dispersion fiber
      lasers.

TI  - Measuring patient-perceived quality of care in US hospitals using Twitter.
PG  - 404-13
LID - 10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients routinely use Twitter to share feedback about their
      experience receiving healthcare. Identifying and analysing the content of posts
      sent to hospitals may provide a novel real-time measure of quality, supplementing
      traditional, survey-based approaches. OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of Twitter as 
      a supplemental data stream for measuring patient-perceived quality of care in US 
      hospitals and compare patient sentiments about hospitals with established quality
      measures. DESIGN: 404 065 tweets directed to 2349 US hospitals over a 1-year
      period were classified as having to do with patient experience using a machine
      learning approach. Sentiment was calculated for these tweets using natural
      language processing. 11 602 tweets were manually categorised into patient
      experience topics. Finally, hospitals with >/=50 patient experience tweets were
      surveyed to understand how they use Twitter to interact with patients. KEY
      RESULTS: Roughly half of the hospitals in the US have a presence on Twitter. Of
      the tweets directed toward these hospitals, 34 725 (9.4%) were related to patient
      experience and covered diverse topics. Analyses limited to hospitals with >/=50
      patient experience tweets revealed that they were more active on Twitter, more
      likely to be below the national median of Medicare patients (p<0.001) and above
      the national median for nurse/patient ratio (p=0.006), and to be a non-profit
      hospital (p<0.001). After adjusting for hospital characteristics, we found that
      Twitter sentiment was not associated with Hospital Consumer Assessment of
      Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) ratings (but having a Twitter account
      was), although there was a weak association with 30-day hospital readmission
      rates (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Tweets describing patient experiences in hospitals 
      cover a wide range of patient care aspects and can be identified using automated 
      approaches. These tweets represent a potentially untapped indicator of quality
      and may be valuable to patients, researchers, policy makers and hospital
      administrators.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and scalable surveillance methods are critical to understand
      widespread problems associated with misuse and abuse of prescription opioids and 
      for implementing effective prevention and control measures. Traditional
      diagnostic coding incompletely documents problem use. Relevant information for
      each patient is often obscured in vast amounts of clinical text. OBJECTIVES: We
      developed and evaluated a method that combines natural language processing (NLP) 
      and computer-assisted manual review of clinical notes to identify evidence of
      problem opioid use in electronic health records (EHRs). METHODS: We used the EHR 
      data and text of 22,142 patients receiving chronic opioid therapy (>/=70 days'
      supply of opioids per calendar quarter) during 2006-2012 to develop and evaluate 
      an NLP-based surveillance method and compare it to traditional methods based on
      International Classification of Disease, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) codes. We
      developed a 1288-term dictionary for clinician mentions of opioid addiction,
      abuse, misuse or overuse, and an NLP system to identify these mentions in
      unstructured text. The system distinguished affirmative mentions from those that 
      were negated or otherwise qualified. We applied this system to 7336,445
      electronic chart notes of the 22,142 patients. Trained abstractors using a custom
      computer-assisted software interface manually reviewed 7751 chart notes (from
      3156 patients) selected by the NLP system and classified each note as to whether 
      or not it contained textual evidence of problem opioid use. RESULTS: Traditional 
      diagnostic codes for problem opioid use were found for 2240 (10.1%) patients.
      NLP-assisted manual review identified an additional 728 (3.1%) patients with
      evidence of clinically diagnosed problem opioid use in clinical notes.
      Inter-rater reliability among pairs of abstractors reviewing notes was high, with
      kappa=0.86 and 97% agreement for one pair, and kappa=0.71 and 88% agreement for
      another pair. CONCLUSIONS: Scalable, semi-automated NLP methods can efficiently
      and accurately identify evidence of problem opioid use in vast amounts of EHR
      text. Incorporating such methods into surveillance efforts may increase
      prevalence estimates by as much as one-third relative to traditional methods.

      Measurements in Narrative Radiology Reports.
PG  - 600-110
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2014-11-RA-0110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating quantitative outcome parameters may contribute to
      constructing a healthcare organization in which outcomes of clinical procedures
      are reproducible and predictable. In imaging studies, measurements are the
      principal category of quantitative para meters. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this
      work is to develop and evaluate two natural language processing engines that
      extract finding and organ measurements from narrative radiology reports and to
      categorize extracted measurements by their "temporality". METHODS: The
      measurement extraction engine is developed as a set of regular expressions. The
      engine was evaluated against a manually created ground truth. Automated
      categorization of measurement temporality is defined as a machine learning
      problem. A ground truth was manually developed based on a corpus of radiology
      reports. A maximum entropy model was created using features that characterize the
      measurement itself and its narrative context. The model was evaluated in a
      ten-fold cross validation protocol. RESULTS: The measurement extraction engine
      has precision 0.994 and recall 0.991. Accuracy of the measurement classification 
      engine is 0.960. CONCLUSIONS: The work contributes to machine understanding of
      radiology reports and may find application in software applications that process 
      medical data.

TI  - Epidemiologic trends in medically-attended tree stand fall injuries among
      Wisconsin deer hunters.
PG  - 220-5
LID - 10.1016/j.injury.2015.09.012 [doi]
LID - S0020-1383(15)00550-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tree stand falls are the most common injury to hunters in the USA,
      but there is limited research on the topic. This study examined the 5-year trends
      in incident tree stand fall injuries in rural north-central Wisconsin and
      described patient demographics and injury features. METHODS: A retrospective
      analysis was conducted on five prior hunting seasons, 2009-2013. Cases were
      ascertained from electronic health records via natural language processing that
      identified patients from the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area who received
      medical attention for a tree stand fall. Annual incidence rates were calculated
      using the number of hunting license holders in the target population, per
      administrative data from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. RESULTS: 
      There were 16,556-16,902 deer hunters in any given year, with 39 (92% male)
      confirmed medically-attended tree stand fall injuries in 2009-2013. Injuries
      mainly occurred in the lower extremities (n=23), and included two fatalities and 
      one paralysis case. The risk of tree stand fall injuries went from 6.0 (95% CI:
      3.2, 11.1) per 10,000 hunters in 2009 to 3.6 (95% CI: 1.6, 7.9) per 10,000
      hunters in 2013, which was not a significant change over 5 years (p=0.79). Most
      falls occurred among archery hunters, in the evening and when descending from a
      tree stand. Cases were demographically similar to the general population of
      Wisconsin deer hunters. CONCLUSIONS: The current seasonal incidence rate of tree 
      stand fall injuries is relatively low in rural Wisconsin, but with limited signs 
      of improvement. Continued efforts are needed to promote the long-term safety of
      the hunting public.

LID - 10.1021/acs.joc.5b01743 [doi]
AB  - Herein, we report the synthesis and theoretical investigation of a nonsymmetric
      bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenimine (DAC)-functionalized proton sponge
      derivative, coined the "Janus" sponge. The reported sponge was isolated as a
      monoprotonated salt, though no intramolecular hydrogen bond was observed.
      Homodesmotic equations supported the absence of a N-HN intramolecular hydrogen
      bond and a relatively low freebase strain, while DFT calculations and X-ray
      crystallography revealed the presence of a hydrogen bond to the Cl(-) counterion.
      Associated with this fact was the rare in-out geometry of the basic nitrogens,
      which represents the first such instance in a proton sponge not having an
      ortho-substituent and/or being in a protonated state. Furthermore, NLP donation
      into the cyclopropenium cation was found to stabilize this unprecedented in-out
      geometry. The measured pKa was determined to be 23.8, in good agreement with the 
      computed value of 23.9. Lastly, the Janus sponge was found to have fluorescent
      properties both in the solid state and in solution, which notably represents the 
      first example of a cyclopropenimine-based fluorescent organic compound.

AB  - The 2014 i2b2/UTHealth Natural Language Processing (NLP) shared task featured a
      new longitudinal corpus of 1304 records representing 296 diabetic patients. The
      corpus contains three cohorts: patients who have a diagnosis of coronary artery
      disease (CAD) in their first record, and continue to have it in subsequent
      records; patients who do not have a diagnosis of CAD in the first record, but
      develop it by the last record; patients who do not have a diagnosis of CAD in any
      record. This paper details the process used to select records for this corpus and
      provides an overview of novel research uses for this corpus. This corpus is the
      only annotated corpus of longitudinal clinical narratives currently available for
      research to the general research community.

AB  - Electronic medical records (EMRs) for diabetic patients contain information about
      heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and
      smoking status. Discovering the described risk factors and tracking their
      progression over time may support medical personnel in making clinical decisions,
      as well as facilitate data modeling and biomedical research. Such highly
      patient-specific knowledge is essential to driving the advancement of
      evidence-based practice, and can also help improve personalized medicine and
      care. One general approach for tracking the progression of diseases and their
      risk factors described in EMRs is to first recognize all temporal expressions,
      and then assign each of them to the nearest target medical concept. However, this
      method may not always provide the correct associations. In light of this, this
      work introduces a context-aware approach to assign the time attributes of the
      recognized risk factors by reconstructing contexts that contain more reliable
      temporal expressions. The evaluation results on the i2b2 test set demonstrate the
      efficacy of the proposed approach, which achieved an F-score of 0.897. To boost
      the approach's ability to process unstructured clinical text and to allow for the
      reproduction of the demonstrated results, a set of developed .NET libraries used 
      to develop the system is available at
      https://sites.google.com/site/hongjiedai/projects/nttmuclinicalnet.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the characteristics, visual outcomes, and predictive value
      of the Ocular Trauma Score (OTS) in eyes with traumatic cataract from combat
      ocular trauma. SETTING: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.
      DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Records of service members with
      traumatic cataract from combat ocular trauma over a 7-year period were reviewed. 
      Visual acuity at initial presentation and visual acuity at the final follow-up
      were compared in addition to outcomes in closed versus open globes, by final lens
      status, and in eyes receiving primary versus secondary intraocular lenses (IOLs).
      Visual outcomes were predicted using the OTS and compared to the achieved
      corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). RESULTS: A total of 181 eyes of 167
      patients were included in the final analysis. Twenty-six percent of all eye
      injuries sustained traumatic cataract. The mean final visual outcome was 0.86
      logMAR +/- 1.01 (SD) with 44 no light perception (NLP) eyes and 26 light
      perception (LP) eyes compared with an initial visual acuity of 2.41 +/- 0.88
      logMAR with 27 no NLP eyes and 64 LP eyes (P </= .001, 2-tailed Student t test). 
      Final CDVAs in eyes receiving primary IOLs were 0.72 +/- 0.84 logMAR with 1 NLP
      and 1 LP eye versus 0.51 +/- 0.78 logMAR with 2 LP eyes in eyes receiving a
      secondary IOL (P = .37, Student t test). CONCLUSION: Traumatic cataracts are
      frequently associated with ocular trauma. The OTS is a reliable means of
      predicting visual outcome. There was no difference in eyes receiving primary IOLs
      versus secondary IOLs. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a financial or

AB  - Neuromodulation enables transient restructuring of anatomically fixed neural
      circuits, generating alternate outputs and distinct states that allow for
      flexible organismal responses to changing conditions. We recently identified a
      requirement for the neuropeptide-like protein NLP-12, a Caenorhabditis elegans
      homolog of mammalian Cholecystokinin (CCK), in the control of behavioral
      responses to altered food availability. We showed that deletion of nlp-12 impairs
      turning during local food searching while nlp-12 overexpression is sufficient to 
      induce deep body bends and enhance turning. nlp-12 is solely expressed in the DVA
      interneuron that is located postsynaptic to the dopaminergic PDE neurons and
      presynaptic to premotor and motor neurons, well-positioned for modulating
      sensorimotor tasks. Interestingly, DVA was previously implicated in a NLP-12
      mediated proprioceptive feedback loop during C. elegans locomotion. Here, we
      discuss the modulatory effects of NLP-12 with an emphasis on the potential for
      circuit level integration with olfactory information about food availability. In 
      addition, we propose potential mechanisms by which DVA may integrate distinct
      forms of sensory information to regulate NLP-12 signaling and mediate
      context-dependent modulation of the motor circuit.

TI  - Semantic biomedical resource discovery: a Natural Language Processing framework.
PG  - 77
LID - 10.1186/s12911-015-0200-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A plethora of publicly available biomedical resources do currently
      exist and are constantly increasing at a fast rate. In parallel, specialized
      repositories are been developed, indexing numerous clinical and biomedical tools.
      The main drawback of such repositories is the difficulty in locating appropriate 
      resources for a clinical or biomedical decision task, especially for
      non-Information Technology expert users. In parallel, although NLP research in
      the clinical domain has been active since the 1960s, progress in the development 
      of NLP applications has been slow and lags behind progress in the general NLP
      domain. The aim of the present study is to investigate the use of semantics for
      biomedical resources annotation with domain specific ontologies and exploit
      Natural Language Processing methods in empowering the non-Information Technology 
      expert users to efficiently search for biomedical resources using natural
      language. METHODS: A Natural Language Processing engine which can "translate"
      free text into targeted queries, automatically transforming a clinical research
      question into a request description that contains only terms of ontologies, has
      been implemented. The implementation is based on information extraction
      techniques for text in natural language, guided by integrated ontologies.
      Furthermore, knowledge from robust text mining methods has been incorporated to
      map descriptions into suitable domain ontologies in order to ensure that the
      biomedical resources descriptions are domain oriented and enhance the accuracy of
      services discovery. The framework is freely available as a web application at (
      http://calchas.ics.forth.gr/ ). RESULTS: For our experiments, a range of clinical
      questions were established based on descriptions of clinical trials from the
      ClinicalTrials.gov registry as well as recommendations from clinicians. Domain
      experts manually identified the available tools in a tools repository which are
      suitable for addressing the clinical questions at hand, either individually or as
      a set of tools forming a computational pipeline. The results were compared with
      those obtained from an automated discovery of candidate biomedical tools. For the
      evaluation of the results, precision and recall measurements were used. Our
      results indicate that the proposed framework has a high precision and low recall,
      implying that the system returns essentially more relevant results than
      irrelevant. CONCLUSIONS: There are adequate biomedical ontologies already
      available, sufficiency of existing NLP tools and quality of biomedical annotation
      systems for the implementation of a biomedical resources discovery framework,
      based on the semantic annotation of resources and the use on NLP techniques. The 
      results of the present study demonstrate the clinical utility of the application 
      of the proposed framework which aims to bridge the gap between clinical question 
      in natural language and efficient dynamic biomedical resources discovery.

TI  - What is the potential for context aware communication aids?
PG  - 448-53
LID - 10.3109/03091902.2015.1088091 [doi]
AB  - Use of voice output communication aids (VOCAs) can be a very effective strategy
      to assist people with speech impairments in communicating. Despite this, people
      who use communication aids often express frustration with VOCAs-desiring devices 
      that are simpler, quicker and more effective to use. Whilst it is not possible to
      resolve all these issues with technology, it is argued that significant progress 
      can be made. The use of contextual information is one development that could
      improve the simplicity and effectiveness of communication aid design. Improving
      the effectiveness of communication aids, including through the use of context
      support, is a goal of the NIHR Devices for Dignity Assistive Technology Theme.
      This discussion paper examines the potential for creating 'context aware'
      communication aids. Three projects in which the authors have been involved are
      described to illustrate different approaches to the use of contextual
      information.

TI  - The tool for the automatic analysis of text cohesion (TAACO): Automatic
      assessment of local, global, and text cohesion.
PG  - 1227-1237
AB  - This study introduces the Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Cohesion (TAACO), a 
      freely available text analysis tool that is easy to use, works on most operating 
      systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux), is housed on a user's hard drive (rather than 
      having an Internet interface), allows for the batch processing of text files, and
      incorporates over 150 classic and recently developed indices related to text
      cohesion. The study validates TAACO by investigating how its indices related to
      local, global, and overall text cohesion can predict expert judgments of text
      coherence and essay quality. The findings of this study provide predictive
      validation of TAACO and support the notion that expert judgments of text
      coherence and quality are either negatively correlated or not predicted by local 
      and overall text cohesion indices, but are positively predicted by global indices
      of cohesion. Combined, these findings provide supporting evidence that coherence 
      for expert raters is a property of global cohesion and not of local cohesion, and
      that expert ratings of text quality are positively related to global cohesion.

AB  - The human ability to understand speech is underpinned by a hierarchical auditory 
      system whose successive stages process increasingly complex attributes of the
      acoustic input. It has been suggested that to produce categorical speech
      perception, this system must elicit consistent neural responses to speech tokens 
      (e.g., phonemes) despite variations in their acoustics. Here, using
      electroencephalography (EEG), we provide evidence for this categorical
      phoneme-level speech processing by showing that the relationship between
      continuous speech and neural activity is best described when that speech is
      represented using both low-level spectrotemporal information and categorical
      labeling of phonetic features. Furthermore, the mapping between phonemes and EEG 
      becomes more discriminative for phonetic features at longer latencies, in line
      with what one might expect from a hierarchical system. Importantly, these effects
      are not seen for time-reversed speech. These findings may form the basis for
      future research on natural language processing in specific cohorts of interest
      and for broader insights into how brains transform acoustic input into meaning.

AB  - The possibility of utilizing blended wastewaters from different streams was
      investigated for cost-efficient microalgal cultivation. The influent of a
      domestic wastewater treatment plant and the liquid fertilizer from a swine
      wastewater treatment plant were selected as water- and nutrient-source
      wastewaters, respectively. The growth of Micractinium inermum NLP-F014 in the
      blended wastewater medium without any pretreatment was comparable to that in
      Bold's Basal Medium. The optimum blending ratio of 5-15% (vv(-1)) facilitated
      biomass production up to 5.7 g-dry cell weight (DCW) L(-1), and the maximum
      biomass productivity (1.03 g-DCWL(-1)d(-1)) was achieved after three days of
      cultivation. Nutrient depletion induced lipid accumulation in the cell up to
      39.1% (ww(-1)) and the maximum lipid productivity was 0.19 g-FAMEL(-1)d(-1).
      These results suggest that blending water- and nutrient-source wastewaters at a
      proper ratio without pretreatment can significantly cut costs in microalgae
      cultivation for biodiesel production.

AB  - For the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth de-identification challenge, we introduced a new
      non-parametric Bayesian hidden Markov model using a Dirichlet process (HMM-DP).
      The model intends to reduce task-specific feature engineering and to generalize
      well to new data. In the challenge we developed a variational method to learn the
      model and an efficient approximation algorithm for prediction. To accommodate
      out-of-vocabulary words, we designed a number of feature functions to model such 
      words. The results show the model is capable of understanding local context cues 
      to make correct predictions without manual feature engineering and performs as
      accurately as state-of-the-art conditional random field models in a number of
      categories. To incorporate long-range and cross-document context cues, we
      developed a skip-chain conditional random field model to align the results
      produced by HMM-DP, which further improved the performance.

AB  - The Sewol ferry disaster severely shocked Korean society. The objective of this
      study was to explore how the public mood in Korea changed following the Sewol
      disaster using Twitter data. Data were collected from daily Twitter posts from 1 
      January 2011 to 31 December 2013 and from 1 March 2014 to 30 June 2014 using
      natural language-processing and text-mining technologies. We investigated the
      emotional utterances in reaction to the disaster by analyzing the appearance of
      keywords, the human-made disaster-related keywords and suicide-related keywords. 
      This disaster elicited immediate emotional reactions from the public, including
      anger directed at various social and political events occurring in the aftermath 
      of the disaster. We also found that although the frequency of Twitter keywords
      fluctuated greatly during the month after the Sewol disaster, keywords associated
      with suicide were common in the general population. Policy makers should
      recognize that both those directly affected and the general public still suffers 
      from the effects of this traumatic event and its aftermath. The mood changes
      experienced by the general population should be monitored after a disaster, and
      social media data can be useful for this purpose.

TI  - Can Natural Language Processing Improve the Efficiency of Vaccine Adverse Event
      Report Review?
PG  - 144-50
LID - 10.3414/ME14-01-0066 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual case review of spontaneous adverse event (AE) reports
      remains a cornerstone of medical product safety surveillance for industry and
      regulators. Previously we developed the Vaccine Adverse Event Text Miner (VaeTM) 
      to offer automated information extraction and potentially accelerate the
      evaluation of large volumes of unstructured data and facilitate signal detection.
      OBJECTIVE: To assess how the information extraction performed by VaeTM impacts
      the accuracy of a medical expert's review of the vaccine adverse event report.
      METHODS: The "outcome of interest" (diagnosis, cause of death, second level
      diagnosis), "onset time," and "alternative explanations" (drug, medical and
      family history) for the adverse event were extracted from 1000 reports from the
      Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) using the VaeTM system. We
      compared the human interpretation, by medical experts, of the VaeTM extracted
      data with their interpretation of the traditional full text reports for these
      three variables. Two experienced clinicians alternately reviewed text miner
      output and full text. A third clinician scored the match rate using a predefined 
      algorithm; the proportion of matches and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
      calculated. Review time per report was analyzed. RESULTS: Proportion of matches
      between the interpretation of the VaeTM extracted data, compared to the
      interpretation of the full text: 93% for outcome of interest (95% CI: 91-94%) and
      78% for alternative explanation (95% CI: 75-81%). Extracted data on the time to
      onset was used in 14% of cases and was a match in 54% (95% CI: 46-63%) of those
      cases. When supported by structured time data from reports, the match for time to
      onset was 79% (95% CI: 76-81%). The extracted text averaged 136 (74%) fewer
      words, resulting in a mean reduction in review time of 50 (58%) seconds per
      report. CONCLUSION: Despite a 74% reduction in words, the clinical conclusion
      from VaeTM extracted data agreed with the full text in 93% and 78% of reports for
      the outcome of interest and alternative explanation, respectively. The limited
      amount of extracted time interval data indicates the need for further development
      of this feature. VaeTM may improve review efficiency, but further study is needed
      to determine if this level of agreement is sufficient for routine use.

TI  - Understanding the Relationship between Social Cognition and Word Difficulty. A
      Language Based Analysis of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 522-9
LID - 10.3414/ME15-01-0038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few quantitative studies have been conducted on the relationship
      between society and its languages. Individuals with autistic spectrum disorder
      (ASD) are known to experience social hardships, and a wide range of clinical
      information about their quality of life has been provided through numerous
      narrative analyses. However, the narratives of ASD patients have thus far been
      examined mainly through qualitative approaches. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we
      analyzed adults with ASD to quantitatively examine the relationship between
      language abilities and ASD severity scores. METHODS: We generated phonetic
      transcriptions of speeches by 16 ASD adults at an ASD workshop, and divided the
      participants into 2 groups according to their Social Responsiveness Scale(TM),
      2nd Edition (SRS(TM)-2) scores (where higher scores represent more severe ASD):
      Group A comprised high-scoring ASD adults (SRS(TM)-2 score: >/= 76) and Group B
      comprised low- and intermediate-scoring ASD adults (SRS(TM)-2 score: < 76). Using
      natural language processing (NLP)-based analytical methods, the narratives were
      converted into numerical data according to four language ability indicators, and 
      the relationships between the language ability scores and ASD severity scores
      were compared. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Group A showed a marginally negative
      correlation with the level of Japanese word difficulty (p < .10), while the
      "social cognition" subscale of the SRS(TM)-2 score showed a significantly
      negative correlation (p < .05) with word difficulty. When comparing only male
      participants, Group A demonstrated a significantly lower correlation with word
      difficulty level than Group B (p < .10). CONCLUSION: Social communication was
      found to be strongly associated with the level of word difficulty in speech. The 
      clinical applications of these findings may be available in the near future, and 
      there is a need for further detailed study on language metrics designed for ASD
      adults.

AB  - Protein subcellular localization is an important topic in proteomics since it is 
      related to a proteins overall function, helps in the understanding of metabolic
      pathways, and in drug design and discovery. In this paper, a basic approximation 
      technique from natural language processing called the linear interpolation
      smoothing model is applied for predicting protein subcellular localizations. The 
      proposed approach extracts features from syntactical information in protein
      sequences to build probabilistic profiles using dependency models, which are used
      in linear interpolation to determine how likely is a sequence to belong to a
      particular subcellular location. This technique builds a statistical model based 
      on maximum likelihood. It is able to deal effectively with high dimensionality
      that hinders other traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machines or
      k-Nearest Neighbours without sacrificing performance. This approach has been
      evaluated by predicting subcellular localizations of Gram positive and Gram
      negative bacterial proteins.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Named entity recognition (NER), a sequential labeling task, is one of
      the fundamental tasks for building clinical natural language processing (NLP)
      systems. Machine learning (ML) based approaches can achieve good performance, but
      they often require large amounts of annotated samples, which are expensive to
      build due to the requirement of domain experts in annotation. Active learning
      (AL), a sample selection approach integrated with supervised ML, aims to minimize
      the annotation cost while maximizing the performance of ML-based models. In this 
      study, our goal was to develop and evaluate both existing and new AL methods for 
      a clinical NER task to identify concepts of medical problems, treatments, and lab
      tests from the clinical notes. METHODS: Using the annotated NER corpus from the
      2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge that contained 349 clinical documents with 20,423
      unique sentences, we simulated AL experiments using a number of existing and
      novel algorithms in three different categories including uncertainty-based,
      diversity-based, and baseline sampling strategies. They were compared with the
      passive learning that uses random sampling. Learning curves that plot performance
      of the NER model against the estimated annotation cost (based on number of
      sentences or words in the training set) were generated to evaluate different
      active learning and the passive learning methods and the area under the learning 
      curve (ALC) score was computed. RESULTS: Based on the learning curves of
      F-measure vs. number of sentences, uncertainty sampling algorithms outperformed
      all other methods in ALC. Most diversity-based methods also performed better than
      random sampling in ALC. To achieve an F-measure of 0.80, the best method based on
      uncertainty sampling could save 66% annotations in sentences, as compared to
      random sampling. For the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of words,
      uncertainty sampling methods again outperformed all other methods in ALC. To
      achieve 0.80 in F-measure, in comparison to random sampling, the best uncertainty
      based method saved 42% annotations in words. But the best diversity based method 
      reduced only 7% annotation effort. CONCLUSION: In the simulated setting, AL
      methods, particularly uncertainty-sampling based approaches, seemed to
      significantly save annotation cost for the clinical NER task. The actual benefit 
      of active learning in clinical NER should be further evaluated in a real-time
      setting.

AB  - Influenza is a yearly recurrent disease that has the potential to become a
      pandemic. An effective biosurveillance system is required for early detection of 
      the disease. In our previous studies, we have shown that electronic Emergency
      Department (ED) free-text reports can be of value to improve influenza detection 
      in real time. This paper studies seven machine learning (ML) classifiers for
      influenza detection, compares their diagnostic capabilities against an
      expert-built influenza Bayesian classifier, and evaluates different ways of
      handling missing clinical information from the free-text reports. We identified
      31,268 ED reports from 4 hospitals between 2008 and 2011 to form two different
      datasets: training (468 cases, 29,004 controls), and test (176 cases and 1620
      controls). We employed Topaz, a natural language processing (NLP) tool, to
      extract influenza-related findings and to encode them into one of three values:
      Acute, Non-acute, and Missing. Results show that all ML classifiers had areas
      under ROCs (AUC) ranging from 0.88 to 0.93, and performed significantly better
      than the expert-built Bayesian model. Missing clinical information marked as a
      value of missing (not missing at random) had a consistently improved performance 
      among 3 (out of 4) ML classifiers when it was compared with the configuration of 
      not assigning a value of missing (missing completely at random). The case/control
      ratios did not affect the classification performance given the large number of
      training cases. Our study demonstrates ED reports in conjunction with the use of 
      ML and NLP with the handling of missing value information have a great potential 
      for the detection of infectious diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is the predominant method for colorectal cancer screening
      in the United States. Previous studies have documented variation across
      physicians in colonoscopy quality as measured by the adenoma detection rate
      (ADR). ADR is the primary quality measure of colonoscopy examinations and an
      indicator of the likelihood of subsequent colorectal cancer. There is interest in
      mechanisms to improve the ADR. In Central Illinois, a local employer and a
      quality improvement organization partnered to publically report physician
      colonoscopy quality. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether this initiative was
      associated with an improvement in the ADR. DESIGN: We compared ADRs before and
      after public reporting at a private practice endoscopy center with 11
      gastroenterologists in Peoria, Illinois, who participated in the initiative. To
      generate the ADR, colonoscopy and pathology reports from examinations performed
      over 4 years at the endoscopy center were analyzed by using previously validated 
      natural language processing software. SETTING: A central Illinois endoscopy
      center. RESULTS: The ADR in the pre-public reporting period was 34.3% and 39.2%
      in the post-public reporting period (an increase of 4.9%, P < .001). The increase
      in the right-sided ADR was 5.1% (P < .01), whereas the increase in the left-sided
      ADR was 2.1% (P < .05). The increase in the ADR was 7.8% for screening
      colonoscopies (P < 0.05) and 3.5% for nonscreening colonoscopies (P < .05). All
      but 1 physician's ADR increased (range -2.7% to 10.5%). There was no
      statistically significant change in the advanced ADR (increase of 0.8%, P = .22).
      LIMITATIONS: There was no concurrent control group to assess whether the
      increased ADR was due to a secular trend. CONCLUSION: A public reporting
      initiative on colonoscopy quality was associated with an increase in ADR.

      repository (Partners' Enterprise-wide Allergy Repository), normalized diverse
      food allergen terms into concepts, and encoded these concepts using the
      Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) and Unique
      Ingredient Identifiers (UNII) terminologies. Concept coverage also was assessed
      for these two terminologies. We further categorized allergen concepts into groups
      and calculated the frequencies of these concepts by group. Finally, we conducted 
      an external validation of MTERMS's performance when identifying food allergen
      terms, using a randomized sample from a different institution. RESULTS: We
      identified 158 552 food allergen records (2140 unique terms) in the Partners
      repository, corresponding to 672 food allergen concepts. High-frequency groups
      included shellfish (19.3%), fruits or vegetables (18.4%), dairy (9.0%), peanuts
      (8.5%), tree nuts (8.5%), eggs (6.0%), grains (5.1%), and additives (4.7%).
      Ambiguous, generic concepts such as "nuts" and "seafood" accounted for 8.8% of
      the records. SNOMED-CT covered more concepts than UNII in terms of exact (81.7%
      vs 68.0%) and partial (14.3% vs 9.7%) matches. DISCUSSION: Adverse sensitivities 
      to food are diverse, and existing standard terminologies have gaps in their
      coverage of the breadth of allergy concepts. CONCLUSION: New strategies are
      needed to represent and standardize food adverse sensitivity concepts, to improve
      documentation in EHRs.

TI  - Identification of the ISWI Chromatin Remodeling Complex of the Early Branching
      Eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei.
PG  - 26954-67
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.679019 [doi]
AB  - ISWI chromatin remodelers are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are important
      for the assembly and spacing of nucleosomes, thereby controlling transcription
      initiation and elongation. ISWI is typically associated with different subunits, 
      forming specialized complexes with discrete functions. In the unicellular
      parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African sleeping sickness, TbISWI
      down-regulates RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-transcribed variant surface glycoprotein 
      (VSG) gene expression sites (ESs), which are monoallelically expressed. Here, we 
      use tandem affinity purification to determine the interacting partners of TbISWI.
      We identify three proteins that do not show significant homology with known
      ISWI-associated partners. Surprisingly, one of these is nucleoplasmin-like
      protein (NLP), which we had previously shown to play a role in ES control. In
      addition, we identify two novel ISWI partners, regulator of chromosome
      condensation 1-like protein (RCCP) and phenylalanine/tyrosine-rich protein
      (FYRP), both containing protein motifs typically found on chromatin proteins.
      Knockdown of RCCP or FYRP in bloodstream form T. brucei results in derepression
      of silent variant surface glycoprotein ESs, as had previously been shown for
      TbISWI and NLP. All four proteins are expressed and interact with each other in
      both major life cycle stages and show similar distributions at Pol I-transcribed 
      loci. They are also found at Pol II strand switch regions as determined with
      ChIP. ISWI, NLP, RCCP, and FYRP therefore appear to form a single major ISWI
      complex in T. brucei (TbIC). This reduced complexity of ISWI regulation and the
      presence of novel ISWI partners highlights the early divergence of trypanosomes
      in evolution.

AB  - Clinical trials are essential for determining whether new interventions are
      effective. In order to determine the eligibility of patients to enroll into these
      trials, clinical trial coordinators often perform a manual review of clinical
      notes in the electronic health record of patients. This is a very time-consuming 
      and exhausting task. Efforts in this process can be expedited if these
      coordinators are directed toward specific parts of the text that are relevant for
      eligibility determination. In this study, we describe the creation of a dataset
      that can be used to evaluate automated methods capable of identifying sentences
      in a note that are relevant for screening a patient's eligibility in clinical
      trials. Using this dataset, we also present results for four simple methods in
      natural language processing that can be used to automate this task. We found that
      this is a challenging task (maximum F-score=26.25), but it is a promising
      direction for further research.

AB  - The second track of the 2014 i2b2 challenge asked participants to automatically
      identify risk factors for heart disease among diabetic patients using natural
      language processing techniques for clinical notes. This paper describes a
      rule-based system developed using a combination of regular expressions, concepts 
      from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and freely-available resources
      from the community. With a performance (F1=90.7) that is significantly higher
      than the median (F1=87.20) and close to the top performing system (F1=92.8), it
      was the best rule-based system of all the submissions in the challenge. We also
      used this system to evaluate the utility of different terminologies in the UMLS
      towards the challenge task. Of the 155 terminologies in the UMLS, 129 (76.78%)
      have no representation in the corpus. The Consumer Health Vocabulary had very
      good coverage of relevant concepts and was the most useful terminology for the
      challenge task. While segmenting notes into sections and lists has a significant 
      impact on the performance, identifying negations and experiencer of the medical
      event results in negligible gain.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in both the UK and
      worldwide. The detection of related risk factors and tracking their progress over
      time is of great importance for early prevention and treatment of CAD. This paper
      describes an information extraction system that was developed to automatically
      identify risk factors for heart disease in medical records while the authors
      participated in the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth NLP Challenge. Our approaches rely on
      several nature language processing (NLP) techniques such as machine learning,
      rule-based methods, and dictionary-based keyword spotting to cope with
      complicated clinical contexts inherent in a wide variety of risk factors. Our
      system achieved encouraging performance on the challenge test data with an
      overall micro-averaged F-measure of 0.915, which was competitive to the best
      system (F-measure of 0.927) of this challenge task.

TI  - Insights into Substrate Specificity of NlpC/P60 Cell Wall Hydrolases Containing
      Bacterial SH3 Domains.
PG  - e02327-14
LID - 10.1128/mBio.02327-14 [doi]
LID - e02327-14 [pii]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Bacterial SH3 (SH3b) domains are commonly fused with papain-like
      Nlp/P60 cell wall hydrolase domains. To understand how the modular architecture
      of SH3b and NlpC/P60 affects the activity of the catalytic domain, three putative
      NlpC/P60 cell wall hydrolases were biochemically and structurally characterized. 
      These enzymes all have gamma-d-Glu-A2pm (A2pm is diaminopimelic acid) cysteine
      amidase (or dl-endopeptidase) activities but with different substrate
      specificities. One enzyme is a cell wall lysin that cleaves peptidoglycan (PG),
      while the other two are cell wall recycling enzymes that only cleave stem
      peptides with an N-terminal l-Ala. Their crystal structures revealed a highly
      conserved structure consisting of two SH3b domains and a C-terminal NlpC/P60
      catalytic domain, despite very low sequence identity. Interestingly, loops from
      the first SH3b domain dock into the ends of the active site groove of the
      catalytic domain, remodel the substrate binding site, and modulate substrate
      specificity. Two amino acid differences at the domain interface alter the
      substrate binding specificity in favor of stem peptides in recycling enzymes,
      whereas the SH3b domain may extend the peptidoglycan binding surface in the cell 
      wall lysins. Remarkably, the cell wall lysin can be converted into a recycling
      enzyme with a single mutation. IMPORTANCE: Peptidoglycan is a meshlike polymer
      that envelops the bacterial plasma membrane and bestows structural integrity.
      Cell wall lysins and recycling enzymes are part of a set of lytic enzymes that
      target covalent bonds connecting the amino acid and amino sugar building blocks
      of the PG network. These hydrolases are involved in processes such as cell growth
      and division, autolysis, invasion, and PG turnover and recycling. To avoid
      cleavage of unintended substrates, these enzymes have very selective substrate
      specificities. Our biochemical and structural analysis of three modular NlpC/P60 
      hydrolases, one lysin, and two recycling enzymes, show that they may have evolved
      from a common molecular architecture, where the substrate preference is modulated
      by local changes. These results also suggest that new pathways for recycling PG
      turnover products, such as tracheal cytotoxin, may have evolved in bacteria in
      the human gut microbiome that involve NlpC/P60 cell wall hydrolases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically characterize the
      expression of endometrial cancer- (EC-) associated genes and to analysis the
      functions, pathways, and networks of EC-associated hub proteins. METHODS: Gene
      data for EC were extracted from the PubMed (MEDLINE) database using text mining
      based on NLP. PPI networks and pathways were integrated and obtained from the
      KEGG and other databases. Proteins that interacted with at least 10 other
      proteins were identified as the hub proteins of the EC-related genes network.
      RESULTS: A total of 489 genes were identified as EC-related with P < 0.05, and 32
      pathways were identified as significant (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05). A network of
      EC-related proteins that included 271 interactions was constructed. The 17
      proteins that interact with 10 or more other proteins (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) were
      identified as the hub proteins of this PPI network of EC-related genes. These 17 
      proteins are EGFR, MET, PDGFRB, CCND1, JUN, FGFR2, MYC, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3R2,
      KRAS, MAPK3, CTNNB1, RELA, JAK2, AKT1, and AKT2. CONCLUSION: Our data may help to
      reveal the molecular mechanisms of EC development and provide implications for
      targeted therapy for EC. However, corrections between certain proteins and EC
      continue to require additional exploration.

      microtubule-dependent tissue integrity of breast epithelial mammospheres.
PG  - 2711-22
LID - 10.1038/onc.2015.332 [doi]
AB  - Structural centrosome aberrations are frequently observed in early stage
      carcinomas, but their role in malignant transformation is poorly understood.
      Here, we examined the impact of overexpression of Ninein-like protein (Nlp) on
      the architecture of polarized epithelia in three-dimensional mammospheres. When
      Nlp was overexpressed to levels resembling those seen in human tumors, it formed 
      striking centrosome-related bodies (CRBs), which sequestered Ninein and affected 
      the kinetics of microtubule (MT) nucleation and release. In turn, the profound
      reorganization of the MT cytoskeleton resulted in mislocalization of several
      adhesion and junction proteins as well as the tumor suppressor Scribble,
      resulting in the disruption of epithelial polarity, cell-cell interactions and
      mammosphere architecture. Remarkably, cells harboring Nlp-CRBs displayed an
      enhanced proliferative response to epidermal growth factor. These results
      demonstrate that structural centrosome aberrations cause not only the disruption 
      of epithelial polarity but also favor overproliferation, two phenotypes typically
      associated with human carcinomas.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Literature database search is a crucial step in the development of
      clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews. In the age of information
      technology, the process of literature search is still conducted manually,
      therefore it is costly, slow and subject to human errors. In this research, we
      sought to improve the traditional search approach using innovative query
      expansion and citation ranking approaches. METHODS: We developed a citation
      retrieval system composed of query expansion and citation ranking methods. The
      methods are unsupervised and easily integrated over the PubMed search engine. To 
      validate the system, we developed a gold standard consisting of citations that
      were systematically searched and screened to support the development of
      cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines. The expansion and ranking methods
      were evaluated separately and compared with baseline approaches. RESULTS:
      Compared with the baseline PubMed expansion, the query expansion algorithm
      improved recall (80.2% vs. 51.5%) with small loss on precision (0.4% vs. 0.6%).
      The algorithm could find all citations used to support a larger number of
      guideline recommendations than the baseline approach (64.5% vs. 37.2%, p<0.001). 
      In addition, the citation ranking approach performed better than PubMed's "most
      recent" ranking (average precision +6.5%, recall@k +21.1%, p<0.001), PubMed's
      rank by "relevance" (average precision +6.1%, recall@k +14.8%, p<0.001), and the 
      machine learning classifier that identifies scientifically sound studies from
      MEDLINE citations (average precision +4.9%, recall@k +4.2%, p<0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our unsupervised query expansion and ranking techniques are more
      flexible and effective than PubMed's default search engine behavior and the
      machine learning classifier. Automated citation finding is promising to augment
      the traditional literature search.

AB  - Despite recent progress in prediction and prevention, heart disease remains a
      leading cause of death. One preliminary step in heart disease prediction and
      prevention is risk factor identification. Many studies have been proposed to
      identify risk factors associated with heart disease; however, none have attempted
      to identify all risk factors. In 2014, the National Center of Informatics for
      Integrating Biology and Beside (i2b2) issued a clinical natural language
      processing (NLP) challenge that involved a track (track 2) for identifying heart 
      disease risk factors in clinical texts over time. This track aimed to identify
      medically relevant information related to heart disease risk and track the
      progression over sets of longitudinal patient medical records. Identification of 
      tags and attributes associated with disease presence and progression, risk
      factors, and medications in patient medical history were required. Our
      participation led to development of a hybrid pipeline system based on both
      machine learning-based and rule-based approaches. Evaluation using the challenge 
      corpus revealed that our system achieved an F1-score of 92.68%, making it the
      top-ranked system (without additional annotations) of the 2014 i2b2 clinical NLP 
      challenge.

TI  - Automated Assessment of Patients' Self-Narratives for Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder Screening Using Natural Language Processing and Text Mining.

AB  - Patients' narratives about traumatic experiences and symptoms are useful in
      clinical screening and diagnostic procedures. In this study, we presented an
      automated assessment system to screen patients for posttraumatic stress disorder 
      via a natural language processing and text-mining approach. Four machine-learning
      algorithms-including decision tree, naive Bayes, support vector machine, and an
      alternative classification approach called the product score model-were used in
      combination with n-gram representation models to identify patterns between verbal
      features in self-narratives and psychiatric diagnoses. With our sample, the
      product score model with unigrams attained the highest prediction accuracy when
      compared with practitioners' diagnoses. The addition of multigrams contributed
      most to balancing the metrics of sensitivity and specificity. This article also
      demonstrates that text mining is a promising approach for analyzing patients'
      self-expression behavior, thus helping clinicians identify potential patients
      from an early stage.

      Literature Mining of Protein Phosphorylation Information.
PG  - 17-29
LID - 10.1109/TCBB.2014.2372765 [doi]
AB  - We introduce RLIMS-P version 2.0, an enhanced rule-based information extraction
      (IE) system for mining kinase, substrate, and phosphorylation site information
      from scientific literature. Consisting of natural language processing and IE
      modules, the system has integrated several new features, including the capability
      of processing full-text articles and generalizability towards different
      post-translational modifications (PTMs). To evaluate the system, sets of
      abstracts and full-text articles, containing a variety of textual expressions,
      were annotated. On the abstract corpus, the system achieved F-scores of 0.91,
      0.92, and 0.95 for kinases, substrates, and sites, respectively. The
      corresponding scores on the full-text corpus were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.92. It was
      additionally evaluated on the corpus of the 2013 BioNLP-ST GE task, and achieved 
      an F-score of 0.87 for the phosphorylation core task, improving upon the results 
      previously reported on the corpus. Full-scale processing of all abstracts in
      MEDLINE and all articles in PubMed Central Open Access Subset has demonstrated
      scalability for mining rich information in literature, enabling its adoption for 
      biocuration and for knowledge discovery. The new system is generalizable and it
      will be adapted to tackle other major PTM types. RLIMS-P 2.0 online system is
      available online (http://proteininformationresource.org/rlimsp/) and the
      developed corpora are available from iProLINK
      (http://proteininformationresource.org/iprolink/).

TI  - Unsupervised Topic Modeling in a Large Free Text Radiology Report Repository.
PG  - 59-62
LID - 10.1007/s10278-015-9823-3 [doi]
AB  - Radiology report narrative contains a large amount of information about the
      patient's health and the radiologist's interpretation of medical findings. Most
      of this critical information is entered in free text format, even when structured
      radiology report templates are used. The radiology report narrative varies in use
      of terminology and language among different radiologists and organizations. The
      free text format and the subtlety and variations of natural language hinder the
      extraction of reusable information from radiology reports for decision support,
      quality improvement, and biomedical research. Therefore, as the first step to
      organize and extract the information content in a large multi-institutional free 
      text radiology report repository, we have designed and developed an unsupervised 
      machine learning approach to capture the main concepts in a radiology report
      repository and partition the reports based on their main foci. In this approach, 
      radiology reports are modeled in a vector space and compared to each other
      through a cosine similarity measure. This similarity is used to cluster radiology
      reports and identify the repository's underlying topics. We applied our approach 
      on a repository of 1,899,482 radiology reports from three major healthcare
      organizations. Our method identified 19 major radiology report topics in the
      repository and clustered the reports accordingly to these topics. Our results are
      verified by a domain expert radiologist and successfully explain the repository's
      primary topics and extract the corresponding reports. The results of our system
      provide a target-based corpus and framework for information extraction and
      retrieval systems for radiology reports.

TI  - GPstruct: Bayesian Structured Prediction Using Gaussian Processes.
PG  - 1514-20
LID - 10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2366151 [doi]
AB  - We introduce a conceptually novel structured prediction model, GPstruct, which is
      kernelized, non-parametric and Bayesian, by design. We motivate the model with
      respect to existing approaches, among others, conditional random fields (CRFs),
      maximum margin Markov networks (M3N), and structured support vector machines
      (SVMstruct), which embody only a subset of its properties. We present an
      inference procedure based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The framework can be
      instantiated for a wide range of structured objects such as linear chains, trees,
      grids, and other general graphs. As a proof of concept, the model is benchmarked 
      on several natural language processing tasks and a video gesture segmentation
      task involving a linear chain structure. We show prediction accuracies for
      GPstruct which are comparable to or exceeding those of CRFs and SVMstruct.

TI  - KneeTex: an ontology-driven system for information extraction from MRI reports.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/s13326-015-0033-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the realm of knee pathology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has 
      the advantage of visualising all structures within the knee joint, which makes it
      a valuable tool for increasing diagnostic accuracy and planning surgical
      treatments. Therefore, clinical narratives found in MRI reports convey valuable
      diagnostic information. A range of studies have proven the feasibility of natural
      language processing for information extraction from clinical narratives. However,
      no study focused specifically on MRI reports in relation to knee pathology,
      possibly due to the complexity of knee anatomy and a wide range of conditions
      that may be associated with different anatomical entities. In this paper we
      describe KneeTex, an information extraction system that operates in this domain. 
      METHODS: As an ontology-driven information extraction system, KneeTex makes
      active use of an ontology to strongly guide and constrain text analysis. We used 
      automatic term recognition to facilitate the development of a domain-specific
      ontology with sufficient detail and coverage for text mining applications. In
      combination with the ontology, high regularity of the sublanguage used in knee
      MRI reports allowed us to model its processing by a set of sophisticated
      lexico-semantic rules with minimal syntactic analysis. The main processing steps 
      involve named entity recognition combined with coordination, enumeration,
      ambiguity and co-reference resolution, followed by text segmentation.
      Ontology-based semantic typing is then used to drive the template filling
      process. RESULTS: We adopted an existing ontology, TRAK (Taxonomy for
      RehAbilitation of Knee conditions), for use within KneeTex. The original TRAK
      ontology expanded from 1,292 concepts, 1,720 synonyms and 518 relationship
      instances to 1,621 concepts, 2,550 synonyms and 560 relationship instances. This 
      provided KneeTex with a very fine-grained lexico-semantic knowledge base, which
      is highly attuned to the given sublanguage. Information extraction results were
      evaluated on a test set of 100 MRI reports. A gold standard consisted of 1,259
      filled template records with the following slots: finding, finding qualifier,
      negation, certainty, anatomy and anatomy qualifier. KneeTex extracted information
      with precision of 98.00 %, recall of 97.63 % and F-measure of 97.81 %, the values
      of which are in line with human-like performance. CONCLUSIONS: KneeTex is an
      open-source, stand-alone application for information extraction from narrative
      reports that describe an MRI scan of the knee. Given an MRI report as input, the 
      system outputs the corresponding clinical findings in the form of JavaScript
      Object Notation objects. The extracted information is mapped onto TRAK, an
      ontology that formally models knowledge relevant for the rehabilitation of knee
      conditions. As a result, formally structured and coded information allows for
      complex searches to be conducted efficiently over the original MRI reports,
      thereby effectively supporting epidemiologic studies of knee conditions.

TI  - Negative symptoms in schizophrenia: a study in a large clinical sample of
      patients using a novel automated method.
PG  - e007619
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007619 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify negative symptoms in the clinical records of a large
      sample of patients with schizophrenia using natural language processing and
      assess their relationship with clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Observational study
      using an anonymised electronic health record case register. SETTING: South London
      and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM), a large provider of inpatient and community mental
      healthcare in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 7678 patients with schizophrenia receiving
      care during 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admission, readmission and
      duration of admission. RESULTS: 10 different negative symptoms were ascertained
      with precision statistics above 0.80. 41% of patients had 2 or more negative
      symptoms. Negative symptoms were associated with younger age, male gender and
      single marital status, and with increased likelihood of hospital admission (OR
      1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.39), longer duration of admission (beta-coefficient 20.5
      days, 7.6-33.5), and increased likelihood of readmission following discharge (OR 
      1.58, 1.28 to 1.95). CONCLUSIONS: Negative symptoms were common and associated
      with adverse clinical outcomes, consistent with evidence that these symptoms
      account for much of the disability associated with schizophrenia. Natural
      language processing provides a means of conducting research in large
      representative samples of patients, using data recorded during routine clinical
      practice.

TI  - Desiderata for computable representations of electronic health records-driven
      phenotype algorithms.
PG  - 1220-30
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv112 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly used for clinical
      and translational research through the creation of phenotype algorithms.
      Currently, phenotype algorithms are most commonly represented as noncomputable
      descriptive documents and knowledge artifacts that detail the protocols for
      querying diagnoses, symptoms, procedures, medications, and/or text-driven medical
      concepts, and are primarily meant for human comprehension. We present desiderata 
      for developing a computable phenotype representation model (PheRM). METHODS: A
      team of clinicians and informaticians reviewed common features for multisite
      phenotype algorithms published in PheKB.org and existing phenotype representation
      platforms. We also evaluated well-known diagnostic criteria and clinical
      decision-making guidelines to encompass a broader category of algorithms.
      RESULTS: We propose 10 desired characteristics for a flexible, computable PheRM: 
      (1) structure clinical data into queryable forms; (2) recommend use of a common
      data model, but also support customization for the variability and availability
      of EHR data among sites; (3) support both human-readable and computable
      representations of phenotype algorithms; (4) implement set operations and
      relational algebra for modeling phenotype algorithms; (5) represent phenotype
      criteria with structured rules; (6) support defining temporal relations between
      events; (7) use standardized terminologies and ontologies, and facilitate reuse
      of value sets; (8) define representations for text searching and natural language
      processing; (9) provide interfaces for external software algorithms; and (10)
      maintain backward compatibility. CONCLUSION: A computable PheRM is needed for
      true phenotype portability and reliability across different EHR products and
      healthcare systems. These desiderata are a guide to inform the establishment and 
      evolution of EHR phenotype algorithm authoring platforms and languages.

TI  - Automatically Detecting Failures in Natural Language Processing Tools for Online 
      Community Text.
PG  - e212
LID - 10.2196/jmir.4612 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence and value of patient-generated health text are
      increasing, but processing such text remains problematic. Although existing
      biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tools are appealing, most were
      developed to process clinician- or researcher-generated text, such as clinical
      notes or journal articles. In addition to being constructed for different types
      of text, other challenges of using existing NLP include constantly changing
      technologies, source vocabularies, and characteristics of text. These
      continuously evolving challenges warrant the need for applying low-cost
      systematic assessment. However, the primarily accepted evaluation method in NLP, 
      manual annotation, requires tremendous effort and time. OBJECTIVE: The primary
      objective of this study is to explore an alternative approach-using low-cost,
      automated methods to detect failures (eg, incorrect boundaries, missed terms,
      mismapped concepts) when processing patient-generated text with existing
      biomedical NLP tools. We first characterize common failures that NLP tools can
      make in processing online community text. We then demonstrate the feasibility of 
      our automated approach in detecting these common failures using one of the most
      popular biomedical NLP tools, MetaMap. METHODS: Using 9657 posts from an online
      cancer community, we explored our automated failure detection approach in two
      steps: (1) to characterize the failure types, we first manually reviewed
      MetaMap's commonly occurring failures, grouped the inaccurate mappings into
      failure types, and then identified causes of the failures through iterative
      rounds of manual review using open coding, and (2) to automatically detect these 
      failure types, we then explored combinations of existing NLP techniques and
      dictionary-based matching for each failure cause. Finally, we manually evaluated 
      the automatically detected failures. RESULTS: From our manual review, we
      characterized three types of failure: (1) boundary failures, (2) missed term
      failures, and (3) word ambiguity failures. Within these three failure types, we
      discovered 12 causes of inaccurate mappings of concepts. We used automated
      methods to detect almost half of 383,572 MetaMap's mappings as problematic. Word 
      sense ambiguity failure was the most widely occurring, comprising 82.22% of
      failures. Boundary failure was the second most frequent, amounting to 15.90% of
      failures, while missed term failures were the least common, making up 1.88% of
      failures. The automated failure detection achieved precision, recall, accuracy,
      and F1 score of 83.00%, 92.57%, 88.17%, and 87.52%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We
      illustrate the challenges of processing patient-generated online health community
      text and characterize failures of NLP tools on this patient-generated health
      text, demonstrating the feasibility of our low-cost approach to automatically
      detect those failures. Our approach shows the potential for scalable and
      effective solutions to automatically assess the constantly evolving NLP tools and
      source vocabularies to process patient-generated text.

TI  - Automatic ICD-10 classification of cancers from free-text death certificates.
PG  - 956-65
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.08.004 [doi]
LID - S1386-5056(15)30028-9 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Death certificates provide an invaluable source for cancer mortality
      statistics; however, this value can only be realised if accurate, quantitative
      data can be extracted from certificates--an aim hampered by both the volume and
      variable nature of certificates written in natural language. This paper proposes 
      an automatic classification system for identifying cancer related causes of death
      from death certificates. METHODS: Detailed features, including terms, n-grams and
      SNOMED CT concepts were extracted from a collection of 447,336 death
      certificates. These features were used to train Support Vector Machine
      classifiers (one classifier for each cancer type). The classifiers were deployed 
      in a cascaded architecture: the first level identified the presence of cancer
      (i.e., binary cancer/nocancer) and the second level identified the type of cancer
      (according to the ICD-10 classification system). A held-out test set was used to 
      evaluate the effectiveness of the classifiers according to precision, recall and 
      F-measure. In addition, detailed feature analysis was performed to reveal the
      characteristics of a successful cancer classification model. RESULTS: The system 
      was highly effective at identifying cancer as the underlying cause of death
      (F-measure 0.94). The system was also effective at determining the type of cancer
      for common cancers (F-measure 0.7). Rare cancers, for which there was little
      training data, were difficult to classify accurately (F-measure 0.12). Factors
      influencing performance were the amount of training data and certain ambiguous
      cancers (e.g., those in the stomach region). The feature analysis revealed a
      combination of features were important for cancer type classification, with
      SNOMED CT concept and oncology specific morphology features proving the most
      valuable. CONCLUSION: The system proposed in this study provides automatic
      identification and characterisation of cancers from large collections of
      free-text death certificates. This allows organisations such as Cancer Registries
      to monitor and report on cancer mortality in a timely and accurate manner. In
      addition, the methods and findings are generally applicable beyond cancer
      classification and to other sources of medical text besides death certificates.

      patients. This corpus was de-identified under a broad interpretation of the HIPAA
      guidelines using double-annotation followed by arbitration, rounds of sanity
      checking, and proof reading. The average token-based F1 measure for the
      annotators compared to the gold standard was 0.927. The resulting annotations
      were used both to de-identify the data and to set the gold standard for the
      de-identification track of the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task. All annotated
      private health information were replaced with realistic surrogates automatically 
      and then read over and corrected manually. The resulting corpus is the first of
      its kind made available for de-identification research. This corpus was first
      used for the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task, during which the systems achieved a 
      mean F-measure of 0.872 and a maximum F-measure of 0.964 using entity-based
      micro-averaged evaluations.

AB  - Verbs denote relations between entities acting a role in an event. Thematic roles
      are essential to the correct use of verbs and involve both semantic and syntactic
      aspects. We used repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) to study the
      involvement of three different left parietal sites in the understanding of
      thematic roles. In a sentence-to-picture matching task, twelve participants were 
      asked to judge whether or not a given picture matched with a written sentence.
      Pictures represented simple reversible actions, and sentences were in the active 
      or passive diathesis. Whereas both active and passive sentences require the
      correct encoding of thematic roles, passives also imply thematic reanalysis, as
      the canonical order of thematic roles is systematically reversed. The experiment 
      was divided in three sessions. In each session a different parietal site
      (anterior, middle, posterior) was stimulated at 5 Hz in an event-related fashion,
      time-locked to the presentation of visual stimuli. Results showed increased
      accuracy for passive sentences following posterior parietal stimulation. The
      effect appeared to be (a) TMS-related, as no effect was observed in a control,
      no-TMS experiment with eighteen new participants; (b) independent from semantic
      processes involved in word-picture association, as no TMS-related effects were
      observed in a picture-word matching task. We interpret the results as showing
      that the posterior parietal site is specifically involved in the assignment of
      thematic roles, in particular when the correct interpretation of a sentence
      requires reanalysis of temporarily encoded thematic roles, as in passive
      reversible sentences.

AB  - The 2014 i2b2 natural language processing shared task focused on identifying
      cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels,
      obesity and smoking status among other factors found in health records of
      diabetic patients. In addition, the task involved detecting medications, and time
      information associated with the extracted data. This paper presents the
      development and evaluation of a natural language processing (NLP) application
      conceived for this i2b2 shared task. For increased efficiency, the application
      main components were adapted from two existing NLP tools implemented in the
      Apache UIMA framework: Textractor (for dictionary-based lookup) and cTAKES (for
      preprocessing and smoking status detection). The application achieved a final
      (micro-averaged) F1-measure of 87.5% on the final evaluation test set. Our
      attempt was mostly based on existing tools adapted with minimal changes and
      allowed for satisfying performance with limited development efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze eyes presenting with no
      light perception (NLP) after open globe injury (OGI) to determine visual outcomes
      and prognostic indicators for visual recovery. METHODS: The records of
      consecutive patients with at least 6 months of follow-up presenting with OGI and 
      NLP to a single institution between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2013 were
      reviewed for demographics, ophthalmic history, context and characteristics of
      injury, ocular examination findings, surgical interventions, and follow-up visual
      acuity. Unpaired t-tests and Fisher's Exact tests were used for statistical
      analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients met our inclusion criteria. The mean age 
      was 50.4+/-25.5 (range 8-91) years. Four patients (16%) regained vision (hand
      motion in three patients and light perception in one patient) while 21 patients
      (84%) remained with NLP or had a prosthesis at final follow-up. Fourteen eyes
      (56%) were enucleated; nine (36%) were secondary enucleations. Although the
      sample sizes were small, neither ocular trauma score nor wound size was found to 
      predict visual recovery. CONCLUSION: Four patients regained some vision after
      presenting with NLP due to OGI. These findings suggest that, in select cases,
      physicians should discuss the possibility of regaining some vision.

TI  - Multi-Layer and Recursive Neural Networks for Metagenomic Classification.
PG  - 608-16
LID - 10.1109/TNB.2015.2461219 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in deep learning with neural
      networks, has made a profound impact on fields such as natural language
      processing, image classification, and language modeling; however, feasibility and
      potential benefits of the approaches to metagenomic data analysis has been
      largely under-explored. Deep learning exploits many layers of learning nonlinear 
      feature representations, typically in an unsupervised fashion, and recent results
      have shown outstanding generalization performance on previously unseen data.
      Furthermore, some deep learning methods can also represent the structure in a
      data set. Consequently, deep learning and neural networks may prove to be an
      appropriate approach for metagenomic data. To determine whether such approaches
      are indeed appropriate for metagenomics, we experiment with two deep learning
      methods: i) a deep belief network, and ii) a recursive neural network, the latter
      of which provides a tree representing the structure of the data. We compare these
      approaches to the standard multi-layer perceptron, which has been
      well-established in the machine learning community as a powerful prediction
      algorithm, though its presence is largely missing in metagenomics literature. We 
      find that traditional neural networks can be quite powerful classifiers on
      metagenomic data compared to baseline methods, such as random forests. On the
      other hand, while the deep learning approaches did not result in improvements to 
      the classification accuracy, they do provide the ability to learn hierarchical
      representations of a data set that standard classification methods do not allow. 
      Our goal in this effort is not to determine the best algorithm in terms
      accuracy-as that depends on the specific application-but rather to highlight the 
      benefits and drawbacks of each of the approach we discuss and provide insight on 
      how they can be improved for predictive metagenomic analysis.

AB  - Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental properties
      of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical systems proved
      useful to create several language models. Despite the large amount of studies
      devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a limited number of studies
      have shown how the properties of the underlying physical systems can be employed 
      to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, I
      address this problem by devising complex networks methods that are able to
      improve the performance of current statistical methods. Using a fuzzy
      classification strategy, I show that the topological properties extracted from
      texts complement the traditional textual description. In several cases, the
      performance obtained with hybrid approaches outperformed the results obtained
      when only traditional or networked methods were used. Because the proposed model 
      is generic, the framework devised here could be straightforwardly used to study
      similar textual applications where the topology plays a pivotal role in the
      description of the interacting agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis is frequently used among individuals with first episode
      psychosis and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, little is known
      about the effect of cannabis use on the response to antipsychotic medications and
      how use could affect outcomes. Using natural language processing on clinical data
      from a large electronic case register, we sought to investigate whether
      resistance to antipsychotic treatment mediated poor clinical outcomes associated 
      with cannabis use. METHODS: Data were obtained from 2026 people with first
      episode psychosis in south London, UK. Cannabis use documented in free text
      clinical records was identified with natural language processing. Data for age,
      sex, ethnicity, marital status, psychotic disorder diagnosis, subsequent hospital
      admission, and number of unique antipsychotic medications prescribed were
      obtained using the Clinical Record Interactive Search instrument. The association
      of these variables with cannabis use was analysed with multivariable regression
      and mediation analysis. FINDINGS: 939 people (46.3%) with first episode psychosis
      were using cannabis at first presentation. Cannabis use was most strongly
      associated with being 16-25 years old, male, and single, and was also associated 
      with an increase in number of hospital admissions (incidence rate ratio 1.50, 95%
      CI 1.25-1.80), compulsory hospital admission (odds ratio 1.55, 1.16-2.08), and
      number of days spent in hospital (beta coefficient 35.1 days, 12.1-58.1) over 5
      years' follow-up. An increase in number of unique antipsychotic medications
      mediated an increase in number of hospital admissions (natural indirect effect
      1.11, 1.04-1.17; total effect 1.41, 1.22-1.64), compulsory hospital admission
      (1.27, 1.10-1.45; 1.71, 1.05-2.78), and number of days spent in hospital (16.1,
      6.7-25.5; 19.9, 2.5-37.3). INTERPRETATION: We showed that a substantial number of
      people with first episode psychosis used cannabis and that its use was associated
      with increased likelihood of hospital admission and number of days spent in
      hospital. These associations were partly mediated by an increase in number of
      unique antipsychotic medications prescribed. These findings suggest that cannabis
      might reduce response to conventional antipsychotic treatment and highlight the
      importance of strategies to reduce its use. FUNDING: National Institute for

AB  - Ischemic stroke involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms with complex
      interactions. Efforts to decipher those mechanisms and understand the evolution
      of cerebral injury is key for developing successful interventions. In an
      innovative approach, we use literature mining, natural language processing and
      systems biology tools to construct, annotate and curate a brain ischemia
      interactome. The curated interactome includes proteins that are deregulated after
      cerebral ischemia in human and experimental stroke. Network analysis of the
      interactome revealed a rich-club organization indicating the presence of a
      densely interconnected hub structure of prominent contributors to disease
      pathogenesis. Functional annotation of the interactome uncovered prominent
      pathways and highlighted the critical role of the complement and coagulation
      cascade in the initiation and amplification of injury starting by activation of
      the rich-club. We performed an in-silico screen for putative interventions that
      have pleiotropic effects on rich-club components and we identified estrogen as a 
      prominent candidate. Our findings show that complex network analysis of disease
      related interactomes may lead to a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms 
      and provide cost-effective and mechanism-based discovery of candidate
      therapeutics.

TI  - ReCAP: Feasibility and Accuracy of Extracting Cancer Stage Information From
      Narrative Electronic Health Record Data.
PG  - 157-8; e169-7
LID - 10.1200/JOP.2015.004622 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer stage, one of the most important prognostic factors for
      cancer-specific survival, is often documented in narrative form in electronic
      health records (EHRs). Such documentation results in tedious and time-consuming
      abstraction efforts by tumor registrars and other secondary users. This
      information may be amenable to extraction by automated methods. METHODS: We
      developed a natural language processing algorithm to extract stage statements
      from machine-readable EHR documents, including automated rules to choose the most
      likely stage when discordance was present in the EHR. These methods were
      developed in a training set of patients with lung cancer, independently validated
      in a test set of patients with lung cancer, and compared with the gold standard
      of Vanderbilt Cancer Registry-determined stage (when available). RESULTS: In the 
      combined data set of 2,323 patients (training set, n = 1,103; validation set, n =
      1,220), 751,880 documents were analyzed. A stage statement was extracted from
      2,239 (98.6%) patient EHRs (median, 24 documents per patient). Stage discordance 
      was common, affecting 83.6% of these EHRs. Nevertheless, algorithmically derived 
      stage accuracy was high in the validation set (kappa = 0.906; 95% CI, 0.873 to
      0.939), when including notes generated within 14 weeks from diagnosis.
      CONCLUSION: Accurate stage determination can be achieved through automated
      methods applied to narrative text, despite the frequent presence of discordance
      in such data. Our results also indicate that stage can be automatically captured 
      in a shorter timeframe than the 6-month window used by cancer registries, as
      early as 5 weeks from diagnosis. These methods may be generalizable to large
      narrative cancer data sets.

TI  - Incorporating Statistical Topic Models in the Retrieval of Healthcare Documents.
PG  - 430-4
AB  - Patients often search for information on the web about treatments and diseases
      after they are discharged from the hospital. However, searching for medical
      information on the web poses challenges due to related terms and synonymy for the
      same disease and treatment. In this paper, we present a method that combines
      Statistical Topics Models, Language Models and Natural Language Processing to
      retrieve healthcare related documents. In addition, we test if the incorporation 
      of terms extracted from the patient's discharge summary improves the retrieval
      performance. We show that the proposed framework outperformed the winner of the
      retrieval CLEF eHealth 2013 challenge by 68% in the MAP measure (0:5226 vs
      0:3108), and by 13% in NDCG (0:5202 vs 0:3637). Compared with standard language
      models, we obtain an improvement of 92% in MAP (0:2666) and 45% in NDCG.
      (0:3637).

TI  - Prescription Extraction from Clinical Notes: Towards Automating EMR Medication
      Reconciliation.
PG  - 188-93
AB  - Medication in for ma lion is one of [he most important clinical data types in
      electronic medical records (EMR) This study developed an NLP application
      (PredMED) to extract full prescriptions and their relevant components from a
      large corpus of unstructured ambulatory office visit clinical notes and the
      corresponding structured medication reconciliation (MED REC) data in the EMR.
      PredMED achieved an 84.4% F-score on office visit encounter notes and 95.0% on
      MED"REC data, outperforming two available medication extraction systems. To
      assess the potential for using automatically extracted prescriptions in the
      medication reconciliation task, we manually analyzed discrepancies between
      prescriptions found in clinical encounter notes and in matching MED_REC data for 
      sample patient encounters.

TI  - A Hybrid Approach to Extracting Disorder Mentions from Clinical Notes.
PG  - 183-7
AB  - Crucial information on a patient's physical or mental conditions is provided by
      mentions of disorders, such as disease, syndrome, injury, and abnormality.
      Identifying disorder mentions is one of the most significant steps in clinical
      text analysis. However, there are many surface forms of the same concept
      documented in clinical notes. Some are even recorded disjointedly, briefly, or
      intuitively. Such difficulties have challenged the information extraction systems
      that focus on identifying explicit mentions. In this study, we proposed a hybrid 
      approach to disorder extraction, which leverages supervised machine learning,
      rule-based annotation, and an unsupervised NLP system. To identify different
      surface forms, we exploited rich features, especially the semantic, syntactic,
      and sequential features, for better capturing implicit relationships among words.
      We evaluated our method on the CLEF 2013 eHealth dataset. The experiments showed 
      that our hybrid approach achieves a 0.776 F-score under strict evaluation
      standards, outperforming any participating systems in the Challenge.

TI  - Designing Ontology-based Patterns for the Representation of the Time-Relevant
      Eligibility Criteria of Clinical Protocols.
PG  - 173-7
AB  - The amount of time and money required to screen patients for clinical trial and
      guideline eligibility presents the need for an automated screening process to
      streamline clinical trial enrollment and guideline implementation. This paper
      introduces an ontology-based approach for defining a set of patterns that can be 
      used to represent various types of time-relevant eligibility criteria that may
      appear in clinical protocols. With a focus only on temporal requirements, we
      examined the criteria of 600 protocols and extracted a set of 37 representative
      time-relevant eligibility criteria. 16 patterns were designed to represent these 
      criteria. Using a test set of an additional 100 protocols, it was found that
      these 16 patterns could sufficiently represent 98.5% of the time-relevant
      criteria. After the time-relevant criteria are modeled by these patterns, it will
      allow the potential to (1) use natural language processing algorithms to
      automatically extract temporal constraints from criteria; and (2) develop
      computer rules and queries to automate the processing of the criteria.

TI  - Cumulative Time Series Representation for Code Blue prediction in the Intensive
      Care Unit.
PG  - 162-7
AB  - Patient monitors in hospitals generate a high number of false alarms that
      compromise patients care and burden clinicians. In our previous work, an attempt 
      to alleviate this problem by finding combinations of monitor alarms and
      laboratory test that were predictive of code blue events, called SuperAlarms. Our
      current work consists of developing a novel time series representation that
      accounts for both cumulative effects and temporality was developed, and it is
      applied to code blue prediction in the intensive care unit (ICU). The health
      status of patients is represented both by a term frequency approach, TF, often
      used in natural language processing; and by our novel cumulative approach. We
      call this representation "weighted accumulated occurrence representation", or
      WAOR. These two representations are fed into a L1 regularized logistic regression
      classifier, and are used to predict code blue events. Our performance was
      assessed online in an independent set. We report the sensitivity of our algorithm
      at different time windows prior to the code blue event, as well as the work-up to
      detect ratio and the proportion of false code blue detections divided by the
      number of false monitor alarms. We obtained a better performance with our
      cumulative representation, retaining a sensitivity close to our previous work
      while improving the other metrics.

TI  - A Semantic Web-based System for Mining Genetic Mutations in Cancer Clinical
      Trials.
PG  - 142-6
AB  - Textual eligibility criteria in clinical trial protocols contain important
      information about potential clinically relevant pharmacogenomic events. Manual
      curation for harvesting this evidence is intractable as it is error prone and
      time consuming. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a Semantic Web-based
      system that captures and manages mutation evidences and related contextual
      information from cancer clinical trials. The system has 2 main components: an
      NLP-based annotator and a Semantic Web ontology-based annotation manager. We
      evaluated the performance of the annotator in terms of precision and recall. We
      demonstrated the usefulness of the system by conducting case studies in
      retrieving relevant clinical trials using a collection of mutations identified
      from TCGA Leukemia patients and Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology
      and Haematology. In conclusion, our system using Semantic Web technologies
      provides an effective framework for extraction, annotation, standardization and
      management of genetic mutations in cancer clinical trials.

TI  - Effect of Nanometric Lactobacillus plantarum in Kimchi on Dextran Sulfate
      Sodium-Induced Colitis in Mice.
PG  - 1073-80
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2015.3509 [doi]
AB  - Nanometric Lactobacillus plantarum (nLp) is a processed form of Lab. plantarum
      derived from kimchi and is 0.5-1.0 mum in size. This study was undertaken to
      determine the effect of nLp and kimchi plus nLp (K-nLp) on a dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model of colitis. Animals fed nLp or K-nLp had longer 
      colons, but lower colon weights per unit length than DSS controls. In addition,
      nLp- or K-nLp-fed animals showed lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines and
      inflammatory genes in serum and in colon tissues, lower populations of total
      bacteria, but higher populations of lactic acid bacteria in feces, and lower
      activities of fecal beta-glucosidase and beta-glucuronidase. Furthermore, these
      suppressive activities of nLp on colitis were equivalent to or higher than those 
      of naive Lab. plantarum. Consequently, nLp was found to exhibit anticolitic
      effects, and the addition of nLp to kimchi was found to enhance the protective
      activity of kimchi against DSS-induced colitis. These results suggest that nLp
      might be an effective substitute for live probiotics and be useful as a
      functional ingredient with the anticolitic activity by the probiotic and food
      processing industries.

AB  - We present the design, and analyze the performance of a multi-stage natural
      language processing system employing named entity recognition, Bayesian
      statistics, and rule logic to identify and characterize heart disease risk factor
      events in diabetic patients over time. The system was originally developed for
      the 2014 i2b2 Challenges in Natural Language in Clinical Data. The system's
      strengths included a high level of accuracy for identifying named entities
      associated with heart disease risk factor events. The system's primary weakness
      was due to inaccuracies when characterizing the attributes of some events. For
      example, determining the relative time of an event with respect to the record
      date, whether an event is attributable to the patient's history or the patient's 
      family history, and differentiating between current and prior smoking status. We 
      believe these inaccuracies were due in large part to the lack of an effective
      approach for integrating context into our event detection model. To address these
      inaccuracies, we explore the addition of a distributional semantic model for
      characterizing contextual evidence of heart disease risk factor events. Using
      this semantic model, we raise our initial 2014 i2b2 Challenges in Natural
      Language of Clinical data F1 score of 0.838 to 0.890 and increased precision by
      10.3% without use of any lexicons that might bias our results.

TI  - Sentiment Measured in Hospital Discharge Notes Is Associated with Readmission and
      Mortality Risk: An Electronic Health Record Study.
PG  - e0136341
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0136341 [doi]
AB  - Natural language processing tools allow the characterization of sentiment--that
      is, terms expressing positive and negative emotion--in text. Applying such tools 
      to electronic health records may provide insight into meaningful patient or
      clinician features not captured in coded data alone. We performed sentiment
      analysis on 2,484 hospital discharge notes for 2,010 individuals from a
      psychiatric inpatient unit, as well as 20,859 hospital discharges for 15,011
      individuals from general medical units, in a large New England health system
      between January 2011 and 2014. The primary measures of sentiment captured
      intensity of subjective positive or negative sentiment expressed in the discharge
      notes. Mean scores were contrasted between sociodemographic and clinical groups
      in mixed effects regression models. Discharge note sentiment was then examined
      for association with risk for readmission in Cox regression models. Discharge
      notes for individuals with greater medical comorbidity were modestly but
      significantly lower in positive sentiment among both psychiatric and general
      medical cohorts (p<0.001 in each). Greater positive sentiment at discharge was
      associated with significantly decreased risk of hospital readmission in each
      cohort (~12% decrease per standard deviation above the mean). Automated
      characterization of discharge notes in terms of sentiment identifies differences 
      between sociodemographic groups, as well as in clinical outcomes, and is not
      explained by differences in diagnosis. Clinician sentiment merits investigation
      to understand why and how it reflects or impacts outcomes.

TI  - Methods to Develop an Electronic Medical Record Phenotype Algorithm to Compare
      the Risk of Coronary Artery Disease across 3 Chronic Disease Cohorts.
PG  - e0136651
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0136651 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Typically, algorithms to classify phenotypes using electronic medical
      record (EMR) data were developed to perform well in a specific patient
      population. There is increasing interest in analyses which can allow study of a
      specific outcome across different diseases. Such a study in the EMR would require
      an algorithm that can be applied across different patient populations. Our
      objectives were: (1) to develop an algorithm that would enable the study of
      coronary artery disease (CAD) across diverse patient populations; (2) to study
      the impact of adding narrative data extracted using natural language processing
      (NLP) in the algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate how to implement CAD
      algorithm to compare risk across 3 chronic diseases in a preliminary study.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 3 established EMR based patient cohorts: diabetes
      mellitus (DM, n = 65,099), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, n = 10,974), and
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 4,453) from two large academic centers. We
      developed a CAD algorithm using NLP in addition to structured data (e.g. ICD9
      codes) in the RA cohort and validated it in the DM and IBD cohorts. The CAD
      algorithm using NLP in addition to structured data achieved specificity >95% with
      a positive predictive value (PPV) 90% in the training (RA) and validation sets
      (IBD and DM). The addition of NLP data improved the sensitivity for all cohorts, 
      classifying an additional 17% of CAD subjects in IBD and 10% in DM while
      maintaining PPV of 90%. The algorithm classified 16,488 DM (26.1%), 457 IBD
      (4.2%), and 245 RA (5.0%) with CAD. In a cross-sectional analysis, CAD risk was
      63% lower in RA and 68% lower in IBD compared to DM (p<0.0001) after adjusting
      for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and
      validated a CAD algorithm that performed well across diverse patient populations.
      The addition of NLP into the CAD algorithm improved the sensitivity of the
      algorithm, particularly in cohorts where the prevalence of CAD was low.
      Preliminary data suggest that CAD risk was significantly lower in RA and IBD
      compared to DM.

TI  - Accessing primary care Big Data: the development of a software algorithm to
      explore the rich content of consultation records.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a natural language processing software inference algorithm 
      to classify the content of primary care consultations using electronic health
      record Big Data and subsequently test the algorithm's ability to estimate the
      prevalence and burden of childhood respiratory illness in primary care. DESIGN:
      Algorithm development and validation study. To classify consultations, the
      algorithm is designed to interrogate clinical narrative entered as free text,
      diagnostic (Read) codes created and medications prescribed on the day of the
      consultation. SETTING: Thirty-six consenting primary care practices from a mixed 
      urban and semirural region of New Zealand. Three independent sets of 1200 child
      consultation records were randomly extracted from a data set of all general
      practitioner consultations in participating practices between 1 January 2008-31
      December 2013 for children under 18 years of age (n=754,242). Each consultation
      record within these sets was independently classified by two expert clinicians as
      respiratory or non-respiratory, and subclassified according to respiratory
      diagnostic categories to create three 'gold standard' sets of classified records.
      These three gold standard record sets were used to train, test and validate the
      algorithm. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value 
      and F-measure were calculated to illustrate the algorithm's ability to replicate 
      judgements of expert clinicians within the 1200 record gold standard validation
      set. RESULTS: The algorithm was able to identify respiratory consultations in the
      1200 record validation set with a sensitivity of 0.72 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.78) and a
      specificity of 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.98). The positive predictive value of
      algorithm respiratory classification was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.97). The positive
      predictive value of the algorithm classifying consultations as being related to
      specific respiratory diagnostic categories ranged from 0.68 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.00;
      other respiratory conditions) to 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; throat infections).
      CONCLUSIONS: A software inference algorithm that uses primary care Big Data can
      accurately classify the content of clinical consultations. This algorithm will
      enable accurate estimation of the prevalence of childhood respiratory illness in 
      primary care and resultant service utilisation. The methodology can also be
      applied to other areas of clinical care.

LID - 10.15265/IY-2015-035 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize recent research and present a selection of the best
      papers published in 2014 in the field of clinical Natural Language Processing
      (NLP). METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was performed by the two
      section editors of the IMIA Yearbook NLP section by searching bibliographic
      databases with a focus on NLP efforts applied to clinical texts or aimed at a
      clinical outcome. A shortlist of candidate best papers was first selected by the 
      section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers.
      RESULTS: The clinical NLP best paper selection shows that the field is tackling
      text analysis methods of increasing depth. The full review process highlighted
      five papers addressing foundational methods in clinical NLP using clinically
      relevant texts from online forums or encyclopedias, clinical texts from
      Electronic Health Records, and included studies specifically aiming at a
      practical clinical outcome. The increased access to clinical data that was made
      possible with the recent progress of de-identification paved the way for the
      scientific community to address complex NLP problems such as word sense
      disambiguation, negation, temporal analysis and specific information nugget
      extraction. These advances in turn allowed for efficient application of NLP to
      clinical problems such as cancer patient triage. Another line of research
      investigates online clinically relevant texts and brings interesting insight on
      communication strategies to convey health-related information. CONCLUSIONS: The
      field of clinical NLP is thriving through the contributions of both NLP
      researchers and healthcare professionals interested in applying NLP techniques
      for concrete healthcare purposes. Clinical NLP is becoming mature for practical
      applications with a significant clinical impact.

      Analysis.
PG  - 183-93
LID - 10.15265/IY-2015-009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We present a review of recent advances in clinical Natural Language
      Processing (NLP), with a focus on semantic analysis and key subtasks that support
      such analysis. METHODS: We conducted a literature review of clinical NLP research
      from 2008 to 2014, emphasizing recent publications (2012-2014), based on PubMed
      and ACL proceedings as well as relevant referenced publications from the included
      papers. RESULTS: Significant articles published within this time-span were
      included and are discussed from the perspective of semantic analysis. Three key
      clinical NLP subtasks that enable such analysis were identified: 1) developing
      more efficient methods for corpus creation (annotation and de-identification), 2)
      generating building blocks for extracting meaning (morphological, syntactic, and 
      semantic subtasks), and 3) leveraging NLP for clinical utility (NLP applications 
      and infrastructure for clinical use cases). Finally, we provide a reflection upon
      most recent developments and potential areas of future NLP development and
      applications. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increase of advances within key NLP 
      subtasks that support semantic analysis. Performance of NLP semantic analysis is,
      in many cases, close to that of agreement between humans. The creation and
      release of corpora annotated with complex semantic information models has greatly
      supported the development of new tools and approaches. Research on non-English
      languages is continuously growing. NLP methods have sometimes been successfully
      employed in real-world clinical tasks. However, there is still a gap between the 
      development of advanced resources and their utilization in clinical settings. A
      plethora of new clinical use cases are emerging due to established health care
      initiatives and additional patient-generated sources through the extensive use of
      social media and other devices.

AB  - In the United States, about 600,000 people die of heart disease every year. The
      annual cost of care services, medications, and lost productivity reportedly
      exceeds 108.9 billion dollars. Effective disease risk assessment is critical to
      prevention, care, and treatment planning. Recent advancements in text analytics
      have opened up new possibilities of using the rich information in electronic
      medical records (EMRs) to identify relevant risk factors. The 2014 i2b2/UTHealth 
      Challenge brought together researchers and practitioners of clinical natural
      language processing (NLP) to tackle the identification of heart disease risk
      factors reported in EMRs. We participated in this track and developed an NLP
      system by leveraging existing tools and resources, both public and proprietary.
      Our system was a hybrid of several machine-learning and rule-based components.
      The system achieved an overall F1 score of 0.9185, with a recall of 0.9409 and a 
      precision of 0.8972.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the prognostic value of the Ocular Trauma Score in patients
      with combined open globe injuries and facial fractures. DESIGN: Retrospective
      cohort study. METHODS: A comprehensive chart review was conducted on 25 patients 
      (28 eyes) identified from the Elmhurst City Hospital Trauma Registry between
      January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2012. Elmhurst City Hospital is a level 1 trauma
      center located in Elmhurst, New York, USA. RESULTS: Average age was 52 (range
      18-88) and patients were predominantly male (84%). The majority of patients had
      an Ocular Trauma Score of 1 (87.5%), and of these patients, 76% and 14% had final
      visual acuities of no light perception (NLP) and light perception/hand motion
      (LP/HM), respectively. These corresponded to 74% and 15% predicted by the
      original Ocular Trauma Score guidelines (100% sensitive and 100% specific).
      Ocular Trauma Score of 1 was associated with zone 3 eye wound location (P = .02).
      Independent of Ocular Trauma Score, initial visual acuity and frontal bone
      fractures were predictive of NLP (P = .006 and P = .047). Nonblindness was
      associated with nasal bone fractures (P = .047). CONCLUSION: This study validates
      the use of the Ocular Trauma Score in patients with combined facial fracture and 
      open globe injury. The presence of facial fractures does not appear to influence 
      visual prognosis for open globe injuries with an Ocular Trauma Score of 1. In the
      absence of data to calculate a full Ocular Trauma Score, initial visual acuity
      was the strongest predictor of final visual outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Electronic healthcare records (EHRs) are a rich source of
      information, with huge potential for secondary research use. The aim of this
      study was to develop an application to identify instances of Adverse Drug Events 
      (ADEs) from free text psychiatric EHRs. METHODS: We used the GATE Natural
      Language Processing (NLP) software to mine instances of ADEs from free text
      content within the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system, a
      de-identified psychiatric case register developed at the South London and
      Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK. The tool was built around a set of four
      movement disorders (extrapyramidal side effects [EPSEs]) related to antipsychotic
      therapy and rules were then generalised such that the tool could be applied to
      additional ADEs. We report the frequencies of recorded EPSEs in patients
      diagnosed with a Severe Mental Illness (SMI) and then report performance in
      identifying eight other unrelated ADEs. RESULTS: The tool identified EPSEs with
      >0.85 precision and >0.86 recall during testing. Akathisia was found to be the
      most prevalent EPSE overall and occurred in the Asian ethnic group with a
      frequency of 8.13%. The tool performed well when applied to most of the non-EPSEs
      but least well when applied to rare conditions such as myocarditis, a condition
      that appears frequently in the text as a side effect warning to patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: The developed tool allows us to accurately identify instances of a
      potential ADE from psychiatric EHRs. As such, we were able to study the
      prevalence of ADEs within subgroups of patients stratified by SMI diagnosis,
      gender, age and ethnicity. In addition we demonstrated the generalisability of
      the application to other ADE types by producing a high precision rate on a
      non-EPSE related set of ADE containing documents. AVAILABILITY: The application
      can be found at http://git.brc.iop.kcl.ac.uk/rmallah/dystoniaml.

TI  - Assessing the readability of ClinicalTrials.gov.
PG  - 269-75
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv062 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: ClinicalTrials.gov serves critical functions of disseminating trial
      information to the public and helping the trials recruit participants. This study
      assessed the readability of trial descriptions at ClinicalTrials.gov using
      multiple quantitative measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis included all 
      165,988 trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as of April 30, 2014. To obtain
      benchmarks, the authors also analyzed 2 other medical corpora: (1) all 955 Health
      Topics articles from MedlinePlus and (2) a random sample of 100,000 clinician
      notes retrieved from an electronic health records system intended for conveying
      internal communication among medical professionals. The authors characterized
      each of the corpora using 4 surface metrics, and then applied 5 different scoring
      algorithms to assess their readability. The authors hypothesized that clinician
      notes would be most difficult to read, followed by trial descriptions and
      MedlinePlus Health Topics articles. RESULTS: Trial descriptions have the longest 
      average sentence length (26.1 words) across all corpora; 65% of their words used 
      are not covered by a basic medical English dictionary. In comparison, average
      sentence length of MedlinePlus Health Topics articles is 61% shorter, vocabulary 
      size is 95% smaller, and dictionary coverage is 46% higher. All 5 scoring
      algorithms consistently rated CliniclTrials.gov trial descriptions the most
      difficult corpus to read, even harder than clinician notes. On average, it
      requires 18 years of education to properly understand these trial descriptions
      according to the results generated by the readability assessment algorithms.
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Trial descriptions at CliniclTrials.gov are extremely 
      difficult to read. Significant work is warranted to improve their readability in 
      order to achieve CliniclTrials.gov's goal of facilitating information
      dissemination and subject recruitment.

AB  - Open-globe injuries with no light perception (NLP) carry a poor prognosis, and
      many ophthalmologists select a primary enucleation or evisceration as a result.
      We present a case of complete visual rehabilitation in a patient who presented
      with NLP after a zone III penetrating open-globe injury. We recommend patient
      counseling regarding decision making and management of ocular trauma with NLP,
      since timely intervention and close follow-ups may restore useful or complete
      vision even in severely traumatized eyes.

TI  - Thirty years of artificial intelligence in medicine (AIME) conferences: A review 
      of research themes.

LID - S0933-3657(15)00087-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past 30 years, the international conference on Artificial
      Intelligence in MEdicine (AIME) has been organized at different venues across
      Europe every 2 years, establishing a forum for scientific exchange and creating
      an active research community. The Artificial Intelligence in Medicine journal has
      published theme issues with extended versions of selected AIME papers since 1998.
      OBJECTIVES: To review the history of AIME conferences, investigate its impact on 
      the wider research field, and identify challenges for its future. METHODS: We
      analyzed a total of 122 session titles to create a taxonomy of research themes
      and topics. We classified all 734 AIME conference papers published between 1985
      and 2013 with this taxonomy. We also analyzed the citations to these conference
      papers and to 55 special issue papers. RESULTS: We identified 30 research topics 
      across 12 themes. AIME was dominated by knowledge engineering research in its
      first decade, while machine learning and data mining prevailed thereafter.
      Together these two themes have contributed about 51% of all papers. There have
      been eight AIME papers that were cited at least 10 times per year since their
      publication. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a major shift from knowledge-based to
      data-driven methods while the interest for other research themes such as
      uncertainty management, image and signal processing, and natural language
      processing has been stable since the early 1990s. AIME papers relating to
      guidelines and protocols are among the most highly cited.

TI  - Integrating Methods to Evaluate Health Information Systems.
PG  - 40603
AB  - There are different methods to evaluate Health Information Systems (HIS), such as
      Quality Evaluation of software products, human factors, and socio-technical
      approaches. This work aims to identify the main aspects used to evaluate HIS, and
      whether there are relationships between issues considered in assessment of
      software quality and the ones applied specific to the health domain. This was an 
      exploratory study that included a literature search related to HIS evaluation and
      software quality analyses applying the norms of the International Organization
      for Standardization (ISO/IEC), to identify aspects and features applied during
      the assessment process. The result is a proposal of an evaluation method based on
      the integration of these two evaluative approaches, combining or complementing
      the considered aspects. The method was applied to an evaluation of a natural
      language processing system to identify continuity of care in discharge summaries.

TI  - Annotation methods to develop and evaluate an expert system based on natural
      language processing in electronic medical records.
PG  - 1067
AB  - The objective of the SYNODOS collaborative project was to develop a generic IT
      solution, combining a medical terminology server, a semantic analyser and a
      knowledge base. The goal of the project was to generate meaningful
      epidemiological data for various medical domains from the textual content of
      French medical records. In the context of this project, we built a care pathway
      oriented conceptual model and corresponding annotation method to develop and
      evaluate an expert system's knowledge base. The annotation method is based on a
      semi-automatic process, using a software application (MedIndex). This application
      exchanges with a cross-lingual multi-termino-ontology portal. The annotator
      selects the most appropriate medical code proposed for the medical concept in
      question by the multi-termino-ontology portal and temporally labels the medical
      concept according to the course of the medical event. This choice of conceptual
      model and annotation method aims to create a generic database of facts for the
      secondary use of electronic health records data.

PG  - 1036
AB  - To translate the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases
      (ICD-11) into French, we proposed a lexical approach using Natural Language
      Processing techniques. This method relies on the 56 biomedical terminologies and 
      ontologies included in the Cross-lingual Health Multiple Terminologies and
      Ontologies Portal. From a sample of 336 ICD-11 terms, the algorithm translated
      164 (49%) terms into at least one French term each.

TI  - A Frequency-based Strategy of Obtaining Sentences from Clinical Data Repository
      for Crowdsourcing.
PG  - 1033-4
AB  - In clinical NLP, one major barrier to adopting crowdsourcing for NLP annotation
      is the issue of confidentiality for protected health information (PHI) in
      clinical narratives. In this paper, we investigated the use of a frequency-based 
      approach to extract sentences without PHI. Our approach is based on the
      assumption that sentences appearing frequently tend to contain no PHI. Both
      manual and automatic evaluations on 500 sentences out of the 7.9 million
      sentences of frequencies higher than one show that no PHI can be found among
      them. The promising results provide potentials of releasing those sentences for
      obtaining sentence-level NLP annotations via crowdsourcing.

TI  - Extracting Dependence Relations from Unstructured Medical Text.
PG  - 1032
AB  - Dependence relations among disease and risk factors are a key ingredient in risk 
      modeling and decision support models. Currently such information is either
      provided by experts (costly and time consuming) or extracted from data (if
      available). The published medical literature represents a promising source of
      such knowledge; however its manual processing is practically infeasible. While a 
      number of solutions have been introduced to add structure to biomedical
      literature, none adequately recover dependence relations. The objective of our
      research is to build such an automatic dependence extraction solution, based on a
      sequence of natural language processing steps, which take as input a set of
      MEDLINE abstracts and provide as output a list of structured dependence
      statements. This paper presents a hybrid pipeline approach, a combination of
      rule-based and machine learning algorithms. We found that this approach
      outperforms a strictly rule-based approach.

TI  - Development and evaluation of task-specific NLP framework in China.
PG  - 1031
AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) has been designed to convert narrative text
      into structured data. Although some general NLP architectures have been
      developed, a task-specific NLP framework to facilitate the effective use of data 
      is still a challenge in lexical resource limited regions, such as China. The
      purpose of this study is to design and develop a task-specific NLP framework to
      extract targeted information from particular documents by adopting dedicated
      algorithms on current limited lexical resources. In this framework, a shared and 
      evolving ontology mechanism was designed. The result has shown that such a free
      text driven platform will accelerate the NLP technology acceptance in China.

AB  - The management of follow-up recommendations is fundamental for the appropriate
      care of patients with incidental pulmonary findings. The lack of communication of
      these important findings can result in important actionable information being
      lost in healthcare provider electronic documents. This study aims to analyze
      follow-up recommendations in radiology reports containing pulmonary incidental
      findings by using Natural Language Processing and Regular Expressions. Our
      evaluation highlights the different follow-up recommendation rates for oncology
      and non-oncology patient cohorts. The results reveal the need for a
      context-sensitive approach to tracking different patient cohorts in an
      enterprise-wide assessment.

TI  - Analyzing Operative Note Structure in Development of a Section Header Resource.
PG  - 821-6
AB  - Operative notes contain essential details of surgical procedures and are an
      important form of clinical documentation. Sections within operative notes segment
      provide high level note structure. We evaluated the HL7 Implementation Guide for 
      Clinical Document Architecture Release 2.0 Operative Note Draft Standard for
      Trial Use (HL7-ON DSTU) Release 1 as well as Logical Observation Identifiers
      Names and Codes (LOINC(R)) section names on 384 unique section headers from
      362,311 operative notes. Overall, HL7-ON DSTU alone and HL7-ON DSTU with LOINC(R)
      section headers covered 66% and 79% of sections headers (93% and 98% of header
      instances), respectively. Section headers contained large numbers of synonyms,
      formatting variation, and variation of word forms, as well as smaller numbers of 
      compound sections and issues with mismatches in header granularity. Robust
      operative note section mapping is important for clinical note interoperability
      and effective use of operative notes by natural language processing systems. The 
      resulting operative note section resource is made publicly available.

TI  - Generating and Executing Complex Natural Language Queries across Linked Data.
PG  - 815-20
AB  - With the recent and intensive research in the biomedical area, the knowledge
      accumulated is disseminated through various knowledge bases. Links between these 
      knowledge bases are needed in order to use them jointly. Linked Data, SPARQL
      language, and interfaces in Natural Language question-answering provide
      interesting solutions for querying such knowledge bases. We propose a method for 
      translating natural language questions in SPARQL queries. We use Natural Language
      Processing tools, semantic resources, and the RDF triples description. The method
      is designed on 50 questions over 3 biomedical knowledge bases, and evaluated on
      27 questions. It achieves 0.78 F-measure on the test set. The method for
      translating natural language questions into SPARQL queries is implemented as Perl
      module available at http://search.cpan.org/ thhamon/RDF-NLP-SPARQLQuery.

TI  - An Approach for Automatic Classification of Radiology Reports in Spanish.
PG  - 634-8
AB  - Automatic detection of relevant terms in medical reports is useful for
      educational purposes and for clinical research. Natural language processing (NLP)
      techniques can be applied in order to identify them. In this work we present an
      approach to classify radiology reports written in Spanish into two sets: the ones
      that indicate pathological findings and the ones that do not. In addition, the
      entities corresponding to pathological findings are identified in the reports. We
      use RadLex, a lexicon of English radiology terms, and NLP techniques to identify 
      the occurrence of pathological findings. Reports are classified using a simple
      algorithm based on the presence of pathological findings, negation and hedge
      terms. The implemented algorithms were tested with a test set of 248 reports
      annotated by an expert, obtaining a best result of 0.72 F1 measure. The output of
      the classification task can be used to look for specific occurrences of
      pathological findings.

TI  - Identifying Patients with Depression Using Free-text Clinical Documents.
PG  - 629-33
AB  - About 1 in 10 adults are reported to exhibit clinical depression and the
      associated personal, societal, and economic costs are significant. In this study,
      we applied the MTERMS NLP system and machine learning classification algorithms
      to identify patients with depression using discharge summaries. Domain experts
      reviewed both the training and test cases, and classified these cases as
      depression with a high, intermediate, and low confidence. For depression cases
      with high confidence, all of the algorithms we tested performed similarly, with
      MTERMS' knowledge-based decision tree slightly better than the machine learning
      classifiers, achieving an F-measure of 89.6%. MTERMS also achieved the highest
      F-measure (70.6%) on intermediate confidence cases. The RIPPER rule learner was
      the best performing machine learning method, with an F-measure of 70.0%, and a
      higher precision but lower recall than MTERMS. The proposed NLP-based approach
      was able to identify a significant portion of the depression cases (about 20%)
      that were not on the coded diagnosis list.

TI  - Named Entity Recognition in Chinese Clinical Text Using Deep Neural Network.
PG  - 624-8
AB  - Rapid growth in electronic health records (EHRs) use has led to an unprecedented 
      expansion of available clinical data in electronic formats. However, much of the 
      important healthcare information is locked in the narrative documents. Therefore 
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, e.g., Named Entity Recognition
      that identifies boundaries and types of entities, has been extensively studied to
      unlock important clinical information in free text. In this study, we
      investigated a novel deep learning method to recognize clinical entities in
      Chinese clinical documents using the minimal feature engineering approach. We
      developed a deep neural network (DNN) to generate word embeddings from a large
      unlabeled corpus through unsupervised learning and another DNN for the NER task. 
      The experiment results showed that the DNN with word embeddings trained from the 
      large unlabeled corpus outperformed the state-of-the-art CRF's model in the
      minimal feature engineering setting, achieving the highest F1-score of 0.9280.
      Further analysis showed that word embeddings derived through unsupervised
      learning from large unlabeled corpus remarkably improved the DNN with randomized 
      embedding, denoting the usefulness of unsupervised feature learning.

TI  - Automatically Expanding the Synonym Set of SNOMED CT using Wikipedia.
PG  - 619-23
AB  - Clinical terminologies and ontologies are often used in natural language
      processing/understanding tasks as a method for semantically tagging text. One
      ontology commonly used for this task is SNOMED CT. Natural language is rich and
      varied: many different combinations of words may be used to express the same
      idea. It is therefore essential that ontologies and terminologies have a rich set
      of synonyms. One source of synonyms is Wikipedia. We examine methods for aligning
      concepts in SNOMED CT with articles in Wikipedia so that newly-found synonyms may
      be added to SNOMED CT. Our experiments show promising results and provide
      guidance to researchers who wish to use Wikipedia for similar tasks.

TI  - Classifying the Indication for Colonoscopy Procedures: A Comparison of NLP
      Approaches in a Diverse National Healthcare System.
PG  - 614-8
AB  - In order to measure the level of utilization of colonoscopy procedures,
      identifying the primary indication for the procedure is required. Colonoscopies
      may be utilized not only for screening, but also for diagnostic or therapeutic
      purposes. To determine whether a colonoscopy was performed for screening, we
      created a natural language processing system to identify colonoscopy reports in
      the electronic medical record system and extract indications for the procedure. A
      rule-based model and three machine-learning models were created using 2,000
      manually annotated clinical notes of patients cared for in the Department of
      Veterans Affairs. Performance of the models was measured and compared. Analysis
      of the models on a test set of 1,000 documents indicates that the rule-based
      system performance stays fairly constant as evaluated on training and testing
      sets. However, the machine learning model without feature selection showed
      significant decrease in performance. Therefore, rule-based classification system 
      appears to be more robust than a machine-learning system in cases when no feature
      selection is performed.

PG  - 604-8
AB  - In this study we have developed a rule-based natural language processing (NLP)
      system to identify patients with family history of pancreatic cancer. The
      algorithm was developed in a Unstructured Information Management Architecture
      (UIMA) framework and consisted of section segmentation, relation discovery, and
      negation detection. The system was evaluated on data from two institutions. The
      family history identification precision was consistent across the institutions
      shifting from 88.9% on Indiana University (IU) dataset to 87.8% on Mayo Clinic
      dataset. Customizing the algorithm on the the Mayo Clinic data, increased its
      precision to 88.1%. The family member relation discovery achieved precision,
      recall, and F-measure of 75.3%, 91.6% and 82.6% respectively. Negation detection 
      resulted in precision of 99.1%. The results show that rule-based NLP approaches
      for specific information extraction tasks are portable across institutions;
      however customization of the algorithm on the new dataset improves its
      performance.

PG  - 599-603
AB  - Knowledge of the left ventricular ejection fraction is critical for the optimal
      care of patients with heart failure. When a document contains multiple ejection
      fraction assessments, accurate classification of their contextual use is
      necessary to filter out historical findings or recommendations and prioritize the
      assessments for selection of document level ejection fraction information. We
      present a natural language processing system that classifies the contextual use
      of both quantitative and qualitative left ventricular ejection fraction
      assessments in clinical narrative documents. We created support vector machine
      classifiers with a variety of features extracted from the target assessment,
      associated concepts, and document section information. The experimental results
      showed that our classifiers achieved good performance, reaching 95.6% F1-measure 
      for quantitative assessments and 94.2% F1-measure for qualitative assessments in 
      a five-fold cross-validation evaluation.

TI  - Identifying Repetitive Institutional Review Board Stipulations by Natural
      Language Processing and Network Analysis.
PG  - 579-83
AB  - The corrections ("stipulations") to a proposed research study protocol produced
      by an institutional review board (IRB) can often be repetitive across many
      studies; however, there is no standard set of stipulations that could be used,
      for example, by researchers wishing to anticipate and correct problems in their
      research proposals prior to submitting to an IRB. The objective of the research
      was to computationally identify the most repetitive types of stipulations
      generated in the course of IRB deliberations. The text of each stipulation was
      normalized using the natural language processing techniques. An undirected
      weighted network was constructed in which each stipulation was represented by a
      node, and each link, if present, had weight corresponding to the TF-IDF Cosine
      Similarity of the stipulations. Network analysis software was then used to
      identify clusters in the network representing similar stipulations. The final
      results were correlated with additional data to produce further insights about
      the IRB workflow. From a corpus of 18,582 stipulations we identified 31 types of 
      repetitive stipulations. Those types accounted for 3,870 stipulations (20.8% of
      the corpus) produced for 697 (88.7%) of all protocols in 392 (also 88.7%) of all 
      the CNS IRB meetings with stipulations entered in our data source. A notable
      peroportion of the corrections produced by the IRB can be considered highly
      repetitive. Our shareable method relied on a minimal manual analysis and provides
      an intuitive exploration with theoretically unbounded granularity. Finer
      granularity allowed for the insight that is anticipated to prevent the need for
      identifying the IRB panel expertise or any human supervision.

TI  - Understanding Deviations from Clinical Practice Guidelines in Adult Soft Tissue
      Sarcoma.
PG  - 280-4
AB  - In recent years we have witnessed the increasing adoption of clinical practice
      guidelines (CPGs) as decision support tools that guide medical treatment. As CPGs
      gain popularity, it has become evident that physicians frequently deviate from
      CPG recommendations, both erroneously and due to sound medical rationale. In this
      study we developed a methodology to computationally identify these deviation
      cases and understand their movitation. This was achieved using an integrated
      approach consisting of natural language processing, data modeling, and comparison
      methods to characterize deviations from CPG recommendations for 1431 adult soft
      tissue sarcoma patients. The results show that 48.9% of patient treatment
      programs deviate from CPG recommendations, with the largest deviation type being 
      overtreatment, followed by differences in drug treatments. Interestingly, we
      identified over a dozen potential reasons for these deviations, with those
      directly related to the patients' cancer status being most abundant. These
      findings can be used to modify CPGs, increase adherence to CPG recommendations,
      reduce treatment cost, and potentially impact sarcoma care. Our approach can be
      applied to additional diseases that are subject to high deviation levels from
      CPGs.

AB  - This study reveals that the entry into World War I in 1917 indexed the decisive
      transition to the modern period in American political consciousness, ushering in 
      new objects of political discourse, a more rapid pace of change of those objects,
      and a fundamental reframing of the main tasks of governance. We develop a
      strategy for identifying meaningful categories in textual corpora that span long 
      historic durees, where terms, concepts, and language use changes. Our approach is
      able to account for the fluidity of discursive categories over time, and to
      analyze their continuity by identifying the discursive stream as the object of
      interest.

TI  - From Generating in the Lab to Tutoring Systems in Classrooms.
PG  - 159-72
AB  - Work in cognitive and educational psychology examines a variety of phenomena
      related to the learning and retrieval of information. Indeed, Alice Healy, our
      honoree, and her colleagues have conducted a large body of groundbreaking
      research on this topic. In this article we discuss how 3 learning principles (the
      generation effect, deliberate practice and feedback, and antidotes to
      disengagement) discussed in Healy, Schneider, and Bourne (2012) have influenced
      the design of 2 intelligent tutoring systems that attempt to incorporate
      principles of skill and knowledge acquisition. Specifically, this article
      describes iSTART-2 and the Writing Pal, which provide students with instruction
      and practice using comprehension and writing strategies. iSTART-2 provides
      students with training to use effective comprehension strategies while
      self-explaining complex text. The Writing Pal provides students with instruction 
      and practice to use basic writing strategies when writing persuasive essays.
      Underlying these systems are the assumptions that students should be provided
      with initial instruction that breaks down the tasks into component skills and
      that deliberate practice should include active generation with meaningful
      feedback, all while remaining engaging. The implementation of these assumptions
      is complicated by the ill-defined natures of comprehension and writing and
      supported by the use of various natural language processing techniques. We argue 
      that there is value in attempting to integrate empirically supported learning
      principles into educational activities, even when there is imperfect alignment
      between them. Examples from the design of iSTART-2 and Writing Pal guide this
      argument.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to proactively manage congestive heart failure (CHF)
      patients, an effective CHF case finding algorithm is required to process both
      structured and unstructured electronic medical records (EMR) to allow
      complementary and cost-efficient identification of CHF patients. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We set to identify CHF cases from both EMR codified and natural language
      processing (NLP) found cases. Using narrative clinical notes from all Maine
      Health Information Exchange (HIE) patients, the NLP case finding algorithm was
      retrospectively (July 1, 2012-June 30, 2013) developed with a random subset of
      HIE associated facilities, and blind-tested with the remaining facilities. The
      NLP based method was integrated into a live HIE population exploration system and
      validated prospectively (July 1, 2013-June 30, 2014). Total of 18,295 codified
      CHF patients were included in Maine HIE. Among the 253,803 subjects without CHF
      codings, our case finding algorithm prospectively identified 2411 uncodified CHF 
      cases. The positive predictive value (PPV) is 0.914, and 70.1% of these 2411
      cases were found to be with CHF histories in the clinical notes. CONCLUSIONS: A
      CHF case finding algorithm was developed, tested and prospectively validated. The
      successful integration of the CHF case findings algorithm into the Maine HIE live
      system is expected to improve the Maine CHF care.

TI  - Active learning: a step towards automating medical concept extraction.
PG  - 289-96
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv069 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an automatic, active learning-based system for the
      extraction of medical concepts from clinical free-text reports. Specifically, (1)
      the contribution of active learning in reducing the annotation effort and (2) the
      robustness of incremental active learning framework across different selection
      criteria and data sets are determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The comparative
      performance of an active learning framework and a fully supervised approach were 
      investigated to study how active learning reduces the annotation effort while
      achieving the same effectiveness as a supervised approach. Conditional random
      fields as the supervised method, and least confidence and information density as 
      2 selection criteria for active learning framework were used. The effect of
      incremental learning vs standard learning on the robustness of the models within 
      the active learning framework with different selection criteria was also
      investigated. The following 2 clinical data sets were used for evaluation: the
      Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside/Veteran Affairs (i2b2/VA)
      2010 natural language processing challenge and the Shared Annotated
      Resources/Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (ShARe/CLEF) 2013 eHealth
      Evaluation Lab. RESULTS: The annotation effort saved by active learning to
      achieve the same effectiveness as supervised learning is up to 77%, 57%, and 46% 
      of the total number of sequences, tokens, and concepts, respectively. Compared
      with the random sampling baseline, the saving is at least doubled. CONCLUSION:
      Incremental active learning is a promising approach for building effective and
      robust medical concept extraction models while significantly reducing the burden 
      of manual annotation.

AB  - What adolescents say when they think about or attempt suicide influences the
      medical care they receive. Mental health professionals use teenagers' words,
      actions, and gestures to gain insight into their emotional state and to prescribe
      what they believe to be optimal care. This prescription is often inconsistent
      among caregivers, however, and leads to varying outcomes. This variation could be
      reduced by applying machine learning as an aid in clinical decision support. We
      designed a prospective clinical trial to test the hypothesis that machine
      learning methods can discriminate between the conversation of suicidal and
      nonsuicidal individuals. Using semisupervised machine learning methods, the
      conversations of 30 suicidal adolescents and 30 matched controls were recorded
      and analyzed. The results show that the machines accurately distinguished between
      suicidal and nonsuicidal teenagers.

      antimicrobial genes in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 145-54
LID - 10.1042/BJ20150563 [doi]
AB  - Three waves of apoptosis shape the development of Caenorhabditis elegans.
      Although the exact roles of the three DNase II genes (nuc-1, crn-6 and crn-7),
      which are known to mediate degradation of apoptotic DNA, in the embryonic and
      larval phases of apoptosis have been characterized, the DNase II acting in the
      third wave of germ cell apoptosis remains undetermined. In the present study, we 
      performed in vitro and in vivo assays on various mutant nematodes to demonstrate 
      that NUC-1 and CRN-7, but not CRN-6, function in germ cell apoptosis. In
      addition, in situ DNA-break detection and anti-phosphorylated ERK
      (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) staining illustrated the sequential and
      spatially regulated actions of NUC-1 and CRN-7, at the pachytene zone of the
      gonad and at the loop respectively. In line with the notion that UV-induced DNA
      fragment accumulation in the gonad activates innate immunity responses, we also
      found that loss of NUC-1 and CRN-7 lead to up-regulation of antimicrobial genes
      (abf-2, spp-1, nlp-29, cnc-2, and lys-7). Our observations suggest that an
      incomplete digestion of DNA fragments resulting from the absence of NUC-1 or
      CRN-7 in the gonad could induce the ERK signalling, consequently activating
      antimicrobial gene expression. Taken together, the results of the present study
      demonstrate for the first time that nuc-1 and crn-7 play a role in degrading
      apoptotic DNA in distinct sites of the gonad, and act as negative regulators of
      innate immunity in C. elegans.

AB  - Automated phenotype identification plays a critical role in cohort selection and 
      bioinformatics data mining. Natural Language Processing (NLP)-informed
      classification techniques can robustly identify phenotypes in unstructured
      medical notes. In this paper, we systematically assess the effect of naive,
      lexically normalized, and semantic feature spaces on classifier performance for
      obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CAD), hyperlipidemia,
      hypertension, and diabetes. We train support vector machines (SVMs) using
      individual feature spaces as well as combinations of these feature spaces on two 
      small training corpora (730 and 790 documents) and a combined (1520 documents)
      training corpus. We assess the importance of feature spaces and training data
      size on SVM model performance. We show that inclusion of semantically-informed
      features does not statistically improve performance for these models. The
      addition of training data has weak effects of mixed statistical significance
      across disease classes suggesting larger corpora are not necessary to achieve
      relatively high performance with these models.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether aspirin use can be 
      captured from the clinical notes in a nonvalvular atrial fibrillation population.
      METHODS: A total of 29,507 patients with newly diagnosed nonvalvular atrial
      fibrillation were identified from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2011, and
      were followed up through December 31, 2012. More than 3 million clinical notes
      were retrieved from electronic medical records. A training data set of 2949 notes
      was created to develop a computer-based method to automatically extract aspirin
      use status and dosage information using natural language processing (NLP). A gold
      standard data set of 5339 notes was created using a blinded manual review. NLP
      results were validated against the gold standard data set. The aspirin data from 
      the structured medication databases were also compared with the results from NLP.
      Positive and negative predictive values, along with sensitivity and specificity, 
      were calculated. FINDINGS: NLP achieved 95.5% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity
      when compared with the gold standard data set. The positive predictive value was 
      93.0%, and the negative predictive value was 99.3%. NLP identified aspirin use
      for 83.8% of the study population, and 70% of the low dose aspirin use was
      identified only by the NLP method. IMPLICATIONS: We developed and validated an
      NLP method specifically designed to identify low dose aspirin use status from the
      clinical notes with high accuracy. This method can be a valuable tool to
      supplement existing structured medication data.

TI  - Selecting registration schemes in case of interstitial lung disease follow-up in 
      CT.
PG  - 4511-25
LID - 10.1118/1.4923170 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Primary goal of this study is to select optimal registration schemes in 
      the framework of interstitial lung disease (ILD) follow-up analysis in CT.
      METHODS: A set of 128 multiresolution schemes composed of multiresolution
      nonrigid and combinations of rigid and nonrigid registration schemes are
      evaluated, utilizing ten artificially warped ILD follow-up volumes, originating
      from ten clinical volumetric CT scans of ILD affected patients, to select
      candidate optimal schemes. Specifically, all combinations of four transformation 
      models (three rigid: rigid, similarity, affine and one nonrigid: third order
      B-spline), four cost functions (sum-of-square distances, normalized correlation
      coefficient, mutual information, and normalized mutual information), four
      gradient descent optimizers (standard, regular step, adaptive stochastic, and
      finite difference), and two types of pyramids (recursive and Gaussian-smoothing) 
      were considered. The selection process involves two stages. The first stage
      involves identification of schemes with deformation field singularities,
      according to the determinant of the Jacobian matrix. In the second stage,
      evaluation methodology is based on distance between corresponding landmark points
      in both normal lung parenchyma (NLP) and ILD affected regions. Statistical
      analysis was performed in order to select near optimal registration schemes per
      evaluation metric. Performance of the candidate registration schemes was verified
      on a case sample of ten clinical follow-up CT scans to obtain the selected
      registration schemes. RESULTS: By considering near optimal schemes common to all 
      ranking lists, 16 out of 128 registration schemes were initially selected. These 
      schemes obtained submillimeter registration accuracies in terms of average
      distance errors 0.18 +/- 0.01 mm for NLP and 0.20 +/- 0.01 mm for ILD, in case of
      artificially generated follow-up data. Registration accuracy in terms of average 
      distance error in clinical follow-up data was in the range of 1.985-2.156 mm and 
      1.966-2.234 mm, for NLP and ILD affected regions, respectively, excluding schemes
      with statistically significant lower performance (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, p <
      0.05), resulting in 13 finally selected registration schemes. CONCLUSIONS:
      Selected registration schemes in case of ILD CT follow-up analysis indicate the
      significance of adaptive stochastic gradient descent optimizer, as well as the
      importance of combined rigid and nonrigid schemes providing high accuracy and
      time efficiency. The selected optimal deformable registration schemes are
      equivalent in terms of their accuracy and thus compatible in terms of their
      clinical outcome.

AB  - This paper presents a natural language processing (NLP) system that was designed 
      to participate in the 2014 i2b2 de-identification challenge. The challenge task
      aims to identify and classify seven main Protected Health Information (PHI)
      categories and 25 associated sub-categories. A hybrid model was proposed which
      combines machine learning techniques with keyword-based and rule-based approaches
      to deal with the complexity inherent in PHI categories. Our proposed approaches
      exploit a rich set of linguistic features, both syntactic and word
      surface-oriented, which are further enriched by task-specific features and
      regular expression template patterns to characterize the semantics of various PHI
      categories. Our system achieved promising accuracy on the challenge test data
      with an overall micro-averaged F-measure of 93.6%, which was the winner of this
      de-identification challenge.

TI  - Automated systems for the de-identification of longitudinal clinical narratives: 
      Overview of 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task Track 1.

AB  - The 2014 i2b2/UTHealth Natural Language Processing (NLP) shared task featured
      four tracks. The first of these was the de-identification track focused on
      identifying protected health information (PHI) in longitudinal clinical
      narratives. The longitudinal nature of clinical narratives calls particular
      attention to details of information that, while benign on their own in separate
      records, can lead to identification of patients in combination in longitudinal
      records. Accordingly, the 2014 de-identification track addressed a broader set of
      entities and PHI than covered by the Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act - the focus of the de-identification shared task that was
      organized in 2006. Ten teams tackled the 2014 de-identification task and
      submitted 22 system outputs for evaluation. Each team was evaluated on their best
      performing system output. Three of the 10 systems achieved F1 scores over .90,
      and seven of the top 10 scored over .75. The most successful systems combined
      conditional random fields and hand-written rules. Our findings indicate that
      automated systems can be very effective for this task, but that de-identification
      is not yet a solved problem.

TI  - Recent Trends in the Identification of Incidental Pulmonary Nodules.
PG  - 1208-14
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201505-0990OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Pulmonary nodules are common incidental findings, but information
      about their incidence in the era of computed tomography (CT) is lacking.
      OBJECTIVES: To examine recent trends in pulmonary nodule identification. METHODS:
      We used electronic health records and natural language processing to identify
      members of an integrated health system who had nodules measuring 4 to 30 mm. We
      calculated rates of chest CT imaging, nodule identification, and receipt of a new
      lung cancer diagnosis within 2 years of nodule identification, and standardized
      rates by age and sex to estimate the frequency of nodule identification in the
      U.S. population in 2010. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2012,
      more than 200,000 adult members underwent 415,581 chest CT examinations. The
      annual frequency of chest CT imaging increased from 1.3 to 1.9% for all adult
      members, whereas the frequency of nodule identification increased from 24 to 31% 
      for all scans performed. The annual rate of chest CT increased from 15.4 to 20.7 
      per 1,000 person-years, and the rate of nodule identification increased from 3.9 
      to 6.6 per 1,000 person-years, whereas the rate of a new lung cancer diagnosis
      remained stable. By extrapolation, more than 4.8 million Americans underwent at
      least one chest CT scan and 1.57 million had a nodule identified, including
      63,000 who received a new lung cancer diagnosis within 2 years. CONCLUSIONS:
      Incidental pulmonary nodules are an increasingly common consequence of routine
      medical care, with an incidence that is much greater than recognized previously. 
      More frequent nodule identification has not been accompanied by increases in the 
      diagnosis of cancerous nodules.

AB  - Polarity classification is the main subtask of sentiment analysis and opinion
      mining, well-known problems in natural language processing that have attracted
      increasing attention in recent years. Existing approaches mainly rely on the
      subjective part of text in which sentiment is expressed explicitly through
      specific words, called sentiment words. These approaches, however, are still far 
      from being good in the polarity classification of patients' experiences since
      they are often expressed without any explicit expression of sentiment, but an
      undesirable or desirable effect of the experience implicitly indicates a positive
      or negative sentiment. This paper presents a method for polarity classification
      of patients' experiences of drugs using domain knowledge. We first build a
      knowledge base of polar facts about drugs, called FactNet, using extracted
      patterns from Linked Data sources and relation extraction techniques. Then, we
      extract generalized semantic patterns of polar facts and organize them into a
      hierarchy in order to overcome the missing knowledge issue. Finally, we apply the
      extracted knowledge, i.e., polar fact instances and generalized patterns, for the
      polarity classification task. Different from previous approaches for personal
      experience classification, the proposed method explores the potential benefits of
      polar facts in domain knowledge aiming to improve the polarity classification
      performance, especially in the case of indirect implicit experiences, i.e.,
      experiences which express the effect of one entity on other ones without any
      sentiment words. Using our approach, we have extracted 9703 triplets of polar
      facts at a precision of 92.26 percent. In addition, experiments on drug reviews
      demonstrate that our approach can achieve 79.78 percent precision in polarity
      classification task, and outperforms the state-of-the-art sentiment analysis and 
      opinion mining methods.

AB  - The second track of the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth natural language processing shared
      task focused on identifying medical risk factors related to Coronary Artery
      Disease (CAD) in the narratives of longitudinal medical records of diabetic
      patients. The risk factors included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity,
      smoking status, and family history, as well as diabetes and CAD, and indicators
      that suggest the presence of those diseases. In addition to identifying the risk 
      factors, this track of the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task studied the presence
      and progression of the risk factors in longitudinal medical records. Twenty teams
      participated in this track, and submitted 49 system runs for evaluation. Six of
      the top 10 teams achieved F1 scores over 0.90, and all 10 scored over 0.87. The
      most successful system used a combination of additional annotations, external
      lexicons, hand-written rules and Support Vector Machines. The results of this
      track indicate that identification of risk factors and their progression over
      time is well within the reach of automated systems.

TI  - Ease of adoption of clinical natural language processing software: An evaluation 
      of five systems.

LID - S1532-0464(15)00148-3 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In recognition of potential barriers that may inhibit the widespread
      adoption of biomedical software, the 2014 i2b2 Challenge introduced a special
      track, Track 3 - Software Usability Assessment, in order to develop a better
      understanding of the adoption issues that might be associated with the
      state-of-the-art clinical NLP systems. This paper reports the ease of adoption
      assessment methods we developed for this track, and the results of evaluating
      five clinical NLP system submissions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A team of human
      evaluators performed a series of scripted adoptability test tasks with each of
      the participating systems. The evaluation team consisted of four "expert
      evaluators" with training in computer science, and eight "end user evaluators"
      with mixed backgrounds in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and health informatics. We
      assessed how easy it is to adopt the submitted systems along the following three 
      dimensions: communication effectiveness (i.e., how effective a system is in
      communicating its designed objectives to intended audience), effort required to
      install, and effort required to use. We used a formal software usability testing 
      tool, TURF, to record the evaluators' interactions with the systems and
      'think-aloud' data revealing their thought processes when installing and using
      the systems and when resolving unexpected issues. RESULTS: Overall, the ease of
      adoption ratings that the five systems received are unsatisfactory. Installation 
      of some of the systems proved to be rather difficult, and some systems failed to 
      adequately communicate their designed objectives to intended adopters. Further,
      the average ratings provided by the end user evaluators on ease of use and ease
      of interpreting output are -0.35 and -0.53, respectively, indicating that this
      group of users generally deemed the systems extremely difficult to work with.
      While the ratings provided by the expert evaluators are higher, 0.6 and 0.45,
      respectively, these ratings are still low indicating that they also experienced
      considerable struggles. DISCUSSION: The results of the Track 3 evaluation show
      that the adoptability of the five participating clinical NLP systems has a great 
      margin for improvement. Remedy strategies suggested by the evaluators included
      (1) more detailed and operation system specific use instructions; (2) provision
      of more pertinent onscreen feedback for easier diagnosis of problems; (3)
      including screen walk-throughs in use instructions so users know what to expect
      and what might have gone wrong; (4) avoiding jargon and acronyms in materials
      intended for end users; and (5) packaging prerequisites required within software 
      distributions so that prospective adopters of the software do not have to obtain 
      each of the third-party components on their own.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a model that predicts future changes in systolic
      blood pressure (SBP) based on structured and unstructured (text-based)
      information from longitudinal clinical records. METHOD: For each patient, the
      clinical records are sorted in chronological order and SBP measurements are
      extracted from them. The model predicts future changes in SBP based on the
      preceding clinical notes. This is accomplished using least median squares
      regression on salient features found using a feature selection algorithm.
      RESULTS: Using the prediction model, a correlation coefficient of 0.47 is
      achieved on unseen test data (p<.0001). This is in contrast to a baseline
      correlation coefficient of 0.39.

AB  - This paper describes the use of an agile text mining platform (Linguamatics'
      Interactive Information Extraction Platform, I2E) to extract document-level
      cardiac risk factors in patient records as defined in the i2b2/UTHealth 2014
      challenge. The approach uses a data-driven rule-based methodology with the
      addition of a simple supervised classifier. We demonstrate that agile text mining
      allows for rapid optimization of extraction strategies, while post-processing can
      leverage annotation guidelines, corpus statistics and logic inferred from the
      gold standard data. We also show how data imbalance in a training set affects
      performance. Evaluation of this approach on the test data gave an F-Score of
      91.7%, one percent behind the top performing system.

TI  - Extracting biomedical events from pairs of text entities.
PG  - S8
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S10-S8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huge amounts of electronic biomedical documents, such as molecular
      biology reports or genomic papers are generated daily. Nowadays, these documents 
      are mainly available in the form of unstructured free texts, which require heavy 
      processing for their registration into organized databases. This organization is 
      instrumental for information retrieval, enabling to answer the advanced queries
      of researchers and practitioners in biology, medicine, and related fields. Hence,
      the massive data flow calls for efficient automatic methods of text-mining that
      extract high-level information, such as biomedical events, from biomedical text. 
      The usual computational tools of Natural Language Processing cannot be readily
      applied to extract these biomedical events, due to the peculiarities of the
      domain. Indeed, biomedical documents contain highly domain-specific jargon and
      syntax. These documents also describe distinctive dependencies, making
      text-mining in molecular biology a specific discipline. RESULTS: We address
      biomedical event extraction as the classification of pairs of text entities into 
      the classes corresponding to event types. The candidate pairs of text entities
      are recursively provided to a multiclass classifier relying on Support Vector
      Machines. This recursive process extracts events involving other events as
      arguments. Compared to joint models based on Markov Random Fields, our model
      simplifies inference and hence requires shorter training and prediction times
      along with lower memory capacity. Compared to usual pipeline approaches, our
      model passes over a complex intermediate problem, while making a more extensive
      usage of sophisticated joint features between text entities. Our method focuses
      on the core event extraction of the Genia task of BioNLP challenges yielding the 
      best result reported so far on the 2013 edition.

PG  - S7
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S10-S7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biomedical event extraction has been a major focus of biomedical
      natural language processing (BioNLP) research since the first BioNLP shared task 
      was held in 2009. Accordingly, a large number of event extraction systems have
      been developed. Most such systems, however, have been developed for specific
      tasks and/or incorporated task specific settings, making their application to new
      corpora and tasks problematic without modification of the systems themselves.
      There is thus a need for event extraction systems that can achieve high levels of
      accuracy when applied to corpora in new domains, without the need for exhaustive 
      tuning or modification, whilst retaining competitive levels of performance.
      RESULTS: We have enhanced our state-of-the-art event extraction system,
      EventMine, to alleviate the need for task-specific tuning. Task-specific details 
      are specified in a configuration file, while extensive task-specific parameter
      tuning is avoided through the integration of a weighting method, a covariate
      shift method, and their combination. The task-specific configuration and
      weighting method have been employed within the context of two different sub-tasks
      of BioNLP shared task 2013, i.e. Cancer Genetics (CG) and Pathway Curation (PC), 
      removing the need to modify the system specifically for each task. With minimal
      task specific configuration and tuning, EventMine achieved the 1st place in the
      PC task, and 2nd in the CG, achieving the highest recall for both tasks. The
      system has been further enhanced following the shared task by incorporating the
      covariate shift method and entity generalisations based on the task definitions, 
      leading to further performance improvements. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that it
      is possible to apply a state-of-the-art event extraction system to new tasks with
      high levels of performance, without having to modify the system internally. Both 
      covariate shift and weighting methods are useful in facilitating the production
      of high recall systems. These methods and their combination can adapt a model to 
      the target data with no deep tuning and little manual configuration.

LID - 10.3762/bjnano.6.149 [doi]
AB  - Literature in the field of nanotechnology is exponentially increasing with more
      and more engineered nanomaterials being created, characterized, and tested for
      performance and safety. With the deluge of published data, there is a need for
      natural language processing approaches to semi-automate the cataloguing of
      engineered nanomaterials and their associated physico-chemical properties,
      performance, exposure scenarios, and biological effects. In this paper, we review
      the different informatics methods that have been applied to patent mining,
      nanomaterial/device characterization, nanomedicine, and environmental risk
      assessment. Nine natural language processing (NLP)-based tools were identified:
      NanoPort, NanoMapper, TechPerceptor, a Text Mining Framework, a Nanodevice
      Analyzer, a Clinical Trial Document Classifier, Nanotoxicity Searcher,
      NanoSifter, and NEIMiner. We conclude with recommendations for sharing
      NLP-related tools through online repositories to broaden participation in
      nanoinformatics.

TI  - Extracting antipsychotic polypharmacy data from electronic health records:
      developing and evaluating a novel process.
PG  - 166
LID - 10.1186/s12888-015-0557-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic prescription information is commonly derived from
      structured fields in clinical health records. However, utilising diverse and
      comprehensive sources of information is especially important when investigating
      less frequent patterns of medication prescribing such as antipsychotic
      polypharmacy (APP). This study describes and evaluates a novel method of
      extracting APP data from both structured and free-text fields in electronic
      health records (EHRs), and its use for research purposes. METHODS: Using
      anonymised EHRs, we identified a cohort of patients with serious mental illness
      (SMI) who were treated in South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust mental
      health care services between 1 January and 30 June 2012. Information about
      antipsychotic co-prescribing was extracted using a combination of natural
      language processing and a bespoke algorithm. The validity of the data derived
      through this process was assessed against a manually coded gold standard to
      establish precision and recall. Lastly, we estimated the prevalence and patterns 
      of antipsychotic polypharmacy. RESULTS: Individual instances of antipsychotic
      prescribing were detected with high precision (0.94 to 0.97) and moderate recall 
      (0.57-0.77). We detected baseline APP (two or more antipsychotics prescribed in
      any 6-week window) with 0.92 precision and 0.74 recall and long-term APP
      (antipsychotic co-prescribing for 6 months) with 0.94 precision and 0.60 recall. 
      Of the 7,201 SMI patients receiving active care during the observation period,
      338 (4.7 %; 95 % CI 4.2-5.2) were identified as receiving long-term APP. Two
      second generation antipsychotics (64.8 %); and first -second generation
      antipsychotics were most commonly co-prescribed (32.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that this is a potentially practical tool for identifying
      polypharmacy from mental health EHRs on a large scale. Furthermore, extracted
      data can be used to allow researchers to characterize patterns of polypharmacy
      over time including different drug combinations, trends in polypharmacy
      prescribing, predictors of polypharmacy prescribing and the impact of
      polypharmacy on patient outcomes.

AB  - Identifying populations of heart failure (HF) patients is paramount to research
      efforts aimed at developing strategies to effectively reduce the burden of this
      disease. The use of electronic medical record (EMR) data for this purpose is
      challenging given the syndromic nature of HF and the need to distinguish HF with 
      preserved or reduced ejection fraction. Using a gold standard cohort of manually 
      abstracted cases, an EMR-driven phenotype algorithm based on structured and
      unstructured data was developed to identify all the cases. The resulting
      algorithm was executed in two cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and
      Genomics (eMERGE) Network with a positive predictive value of >95 %. The
      algorithm was expanded to include three hierarchical definitions of HF (i.e.,
      definite, probable, possible) based on the degree of confidence of the
      classification to capture HF cases in a whole population whereby increasing the
      algorithm utility for use in e-Epidemiologic research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying key variables such as disorders within the clinical
      narratives in electronic health records has wide-ranging applications within
      clinical practice and biomedical research. Previous research has demonstrated
      reduced performance of disorder named entity recognition (NER) and normalization 
      (or grounding) in clinical narratives than in biomedical publications. In this
      work, we aim to identify the cause for this performance difference and introduce 
      general solutions. METHODS: We use closure properties to compare the richness of 
      the vocabulary in clinical narrative text to biomedical publications. We approach
      both disorder NER and normalization using machine learning methodologies. Our NER
      methodology is based on linear-chain conditional random fields with a rich
      feature approach, and we introduce several improvements to enhance the lexical
      knowledge of the NER system. Our normalization method - never previously applied 
      to clinical data - uses pairwise learning to rank to automatically learn term
      variation directly from the training data. RESULTS: We find that while the size
      of the overall vocabulary is similar between clinical narrative and biomedical
      publications, clinical narrative uses a richer terminology to describe disorders 
      than publications. We apply our system, DNorm-C, to locate disorder mentions and 
      in the clinical narratives from the recent ShARe/CLEF eHealth Task. For NER
      (strict span-only), our system achieves precision=0.797, recall=0.713,
      f-score=0.753. For the normalization task (strict span+concept) it achieves
      precision=0.712, recall=0.637, f-score=0.672. The improvements described in this 
      article increase the NER f-score by 0.039 and the normalization f-score by 0.036.
      We also describe a high recall version of the NER, which increases the
      normalization recall to as high as 0.744, albeit with reduced precision.
      DISCUSSION: We perform an error analysis, demonstrating that NER errors outnumber
      normalization errors by more than 4-to-1. Abbreviations and acronyms are found to
      be frequent causes of error, in addition to the mentions the annotators were not 
      able to identify within the scope of the controlled vocabulary. CONCLUSION:
      Disorder mentions in text from clinical narratives use a rich vocabulary that
      results in high term variation, which we believe to be one of the primary causes 
      of reduced performance in clinical narrative. We show that pairwise learning to
      rank offers high performance in this context, and introduce several lexical
      enhancements - generalizable to other clinical NER tasks - that improve the
      ability of the NER system to handle this variation. DNorm-C is a high performing,
      open source system for disorders in clinical text, and a promising step toward
      NER and normalization methods that are trainable to a wide variety of domains and
      entities. (DNorm-C is open source software, and is available with a trained model
      at the DNorm demonstration website:
      http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/tmTools/#DNorm.).

TI  - A framework for ontology-based question answering with application to parasite
      immunology.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/s13326-015-0029-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large quantities of biomedical data are being produced at a rapid
      pace for a variety of organisms. With ontologies proliferating, data is
      increasingly being stored using the RDF data model and queried using RDF based
      querying languages. While existing systems facilitate the querying in various
      ways, the scientist must map the question in his or her mind to the interface
      used by the systems. The field of natural language processing has long
      investigated the challenges of designing natural language based retrieval
      systems. Recent efforts seek to bring the ability to pose natural language
      questions to RDF data querying systems while leveraging the associated
      ontologies. These analyze the input question and extract triples (subject,
      relationship, object), if possible, mapping them to RDF triples in the data.
      However, in the biomedical context, relationships between entities are not always
      explicit in the question and these are often complex involving many intermediate 
      concepts. RESULTS: We present a new framework, OntoNLQA, for querying RDF data
      annotated using ontologies which allows posing questions in natural language.
      OntoNLQA offers five steps in order to answer natural language questions. In
      comparison to previous systems, OntoNLQA differs in how some of the methods are
      realized. In particular, it introduces a novel approach for discovering the
      sophisticated semantic associations that may exist between the key terms of a
      natural language question, in order to build an intuitive query and retrieve
      precise answers. We apply this framework to the context of parasite immunology
      data, leading to a system called AskCuebee that allows parasitologists to pose
      genomic, proteomic and pathway questions in natural language related to the
      parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. We separately evaluate the accuracy of each
      component of OntoNLQA as implemented in AskCuebee and the accuracy of the whole
      system. AskCuebee answers 68 % of the questions in a corpus of 125 questions, and
      60 % of the questions in a new previously unseen corpus. If we allow simple
      corrections by the scientists, this proportion increases to 92 %. CONCLUSIONS: We
      introduce a novel framework for question answering and apply it to parasite
      immunology data. Evaluations of translating the questions to RDF triple queries
      by combining machine learning, lexical similarity matching with ontology classes,
      properties and instances for specificity, and discovering associations between
      them demonstrate that the approach performs well and improves on previous
      systems. Subsequently, OntoNLQA offers a viable framework for building question
      answering systems in other biomedical domains.

AB  - Natural language processing employs computational techniques for the purpose of
      learning, understanding, and producing human language content. Early
      computational approaches to language research focused on automating the analysis 
      of the linguistic structure of language and developing basic technologies such as
      machine translation, speech recognition, and speech synthesis. Today's
      researchers refine and make use of such tools in real-world applications,
      creating spoken dialogue systems and speech-to-speech translation engines, mining
      social media for information about health or finance, and identifying sentiment
      and emotion toward products and services. We describe successes and challenges in
      this rapidly advancing area.

TI  - Mass Spectrometry of Single GABAergic Somatic Motorneurons Identifies a Novel
      Inhibitory Peptide, As-NLP-22, in the Nematode Ascaris suum.
PG  - 2009-23
LID - 10.1007/s13361-015-1177-z [doi]
AB  - Neuromodulators have become an increasingly important component of functional
      circuits, dramatically changing the properties of both neurons and synapses to
      affect behavior. To explore the role of neuropeptides in Ascaris suum behavior,
      we devised an improved method for cleanly dissecting single motorneuronal cell
      bodies from the many other cell processes and hypodermal tissue in the ventral
      nerve cord. We determined their peptide content using matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). The
      reduced complexity of the peptide mixture greatly aided the detection of
      peptides; peptide levels were sufficient to permit sequencing by tandem MS from
      single cells. Inhibitory motorneurons, known to be GABAergic, contain a novel
      neuropeptide, As-NLP-22 (SLASGRWGLRPamide). From this sequence and information
      from the A. suum expressed sequence tag (EST) database, we cloned the transcript 
      (As-nlp-22) and synthesized a riboprobe for in situ hybridization, which labeled 
      the inhibitory motorneurons; this validates the integrity of the dissection
      method, showing that the peptides detected originate from the cells themselves
      and not from adhering processes from other cells (e.g., synaptic terminals).
      Synthetic As-NLP-22 has potent inhibitory activity on acetylcholine-induced
      muscle contraction as well as on basal muscle tone. Both of these effects are
      dose-dependent: the inhibitory effect on ACh contraction has an IC50 of 8.3 x
      10(-9) M. When injected into whole worms, As-NLP-22 produces a dose-dependent
      inhibition of locomotory movements and, at higher levels, complete paralysis.
      These experiments demonstrate the utility of MALDI TOF/TOF MS in identifying
      novel neuromodulators at the single-cell level. Graphical Abstract .

TI  - A Preliminary Study of Clinical Abbreviation Disambiguation in Real Time.
PG  - 364-74
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2014-10-RA-0088 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To save time, healthcare providers frequently use abbreviations while 
      authoring clinical documents. Nevertheless, abbreviations that authors deem
      unambiguous often confuse other readers, including clinicians, patients, and
      natural language processing (NLP) systems. Most current clinical NLP systems
      "post-process" notes long after clinicians enter them into electronic health
      record systems (EHRs). Such post-processing cannot guarantee 100% accuracy in
      abbreviation identification and disambiguation, since multiple alternative
      interpretations exist. METHODS: Authors describe a prototype system for real-time
      Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (rCARD) - i.e., a system
      that interacts with authors during note generation to verify correct abbreviation
      senses. The rCARD system design anticipates future integration with web-based
      clinical documentation systems to improve quality of healthcare records. When
      clinicians enter documents, rCARD will automatically recognize each abbreviation.
      For abbreviations with multiple possible senses, rCARD will show a ranked list of
      possible meanings with the best predicted sense at the top. The prototype
      application embodies three word sense disambiguation (WSD) methods to predict the
      correct senses of abbreviations. We then conducted three experments to evaluate
      rCARD, including 1) a performance evaluation of different WSD methods; 2) a time 
      evaluation of real-time WSD methods; and 3) a user study of typing clinical
      sentences with abbreviations using rCARD. RESULTS: Using 4,721 sentences
      containing 25 commonly observed, highly ambiguous clinical abbreviations, our
      evaluation showed that the best profile-based method implemented in rCARD
      achieved a reasonable WSD accuracy of 88.8% (comparable to SVM - 89.5%) and the
      cost of time for the different WSD methods are also acceptable (ranging from
      0.630 to 1.649 milliseconds within the same network). The preliminary user study 
      also showed that the extra time costs by rCARD were about 5% of total document
      entry time and users did not feel a significant delay when using rCARD for
      clinical document entry. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that it is feasible to
      integrate a real-time, NLP-enabled abbreviation recognition and disambiguation
      module with clinical documentation systems.

PG  - 345-63
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2014-11-RA-0106 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Nationwide Children's Hospital established an i2b2 (Informatics for
      Integrating Biology & the Bedside) application for sleep disorder cohort
      identification. Discrete data were gleaned from semistructured sleep study
      reports. The system showed to work more efficiently than the traditional manual
      chart review method, and it also enabled searching capabilities that were
      previously not possible. OBJECTIVE: We report on the development and
      implementation of the sleep disorder i2b2 cohort identification system using
      natural language processing of semi-structured documents. METHODS: We developed a
      natural language processing approach to automatically parse concepts and their
      values from semi-structured sleep study documents. Two parsers were developed: a 
      regular expression parser for extracting numeric concepts and a NLP based tree
      parser for extracting textual concepts. Concepts were further organized into i2b2
      ontologies based on document structures and in-domain knowledge. RESULTS: 26,550 
      concepts were extracted with 99% being textual concepts. 1.01 million facts were 
      extracted from sleep study documents such as demographic information, sleep study
      lab results, medications, procedures, diagnoses, among others. The average
      accuracy of terminology parsing was over 83% when comparing against those by
      experts. The system is capable of capturing both standard and non-standard
      terminologies. The time for cohort identification has been reduced significantly 
      from a few weeks to a few seconds. CONCLUSION: Natural language processing was
      shown to be powerful for quickly converting large amount of semi-structured or
      unstructured clinical data into discrete concepts, which in combination of
      intuitive domain specific ontologies, allows fast and effective interactive
      cohort identification through the i2b2 platform for research and clinical use.

TI  - Validation of natural language processing to extract breast cancer pathology
      procedures and results.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.4103/2153-3539.159215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathology reports typically require manual review to abstract
      research data. We developed a natural language processing (NLP) system to
      automatically interpret free-text breast pathology reports with limited
      assistance from manual abstraction. METHODS: We used an iterative approach of
      machine learning algorithms and constructed groups of related findings to
      identify breast-related procedures and results from free-text pathology reports. 
      We evaluated the NLP system using an all-or-nothing approach to determine which
      reports could be processed entirely using NLP and which reports needed manual
      review beyond NLP. We divided 3234 reports for development (2910, 90%), and
      evaluation (324, 10%) purposes using manually reviewed pathology data as our gold
      standard. RESULTS: NLP correctly coded 12.7% of the evaluation set, flagged 49.1%
      of reports for manual review, incorrectly coded 30.8%, and correctly omitted 7.4%
      from the evaluation set due to irrelevancy (i.e. not breast-related). Common
      procedures and results were identified correctly (e.g. invasive ductal with 95.5%
      precision and 94.0% sensitivity), but entire reports were flagged for manual
      review because of rare findings and substantial variation in pathology report
      text. CONCLUSIONS: The NLP system we developed did not perform sufficiently for
      abstracting entire breast pathology reports. The all-or-nothing approach resulted
      in too broad of a scope of work and limited our flexibility to identify breast
      pathology procedures and results. Our NLP system was also limited by the lack of 
      the gold standard data on rare findings and wide variation in pathology text.
      Focusing on individual, common elements and improving pathology text report
      standardization may improve performance.

TI  - Application of learning to rank to protein remote homology detection.
PG  - 3492-8
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv413 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Protein remote homology detection is one of the fundamental problems 
      in computational biology, aiming to find protein sequences in a database of known
      structures that are evolutionarily related to a given query protein. Some
      computational methods treat this problem as a ranking problem and achieve the
      state-of-the-art performance, such as PSI-BLAST, HHblits and ProtEmbed. This
      raises the possibility to combine these methods to improve the predictive
      performance. In this regard, we are to propose a new computational method called 
      ProtDec-LTR for protein remote homology detection, which is able to combine
      various ranking methods in a supervised manner via using the Learning to Rank
      (LTR) algorithm derived from natural language processing. RESULTS: Experimental
      results on a widely used benchmark dataset showed that ProtDec-LTR can achieve an
      ROC1 score of 0.8442 and an ROC50 score of 0.9023 outperforming all the
      individual predictors and some state-of-the-art methods. These results indicate
      that it is correct to treat protein remote homology detection as a ranking
      problem, and predictive performance improvement can be achieved by combining
      different ranking approaches in a supervised manner via using LTR. AVAILABILITY
      AND IMPLEMENTATION: For users' convenience, the software tools of three basic
      ranking predictors and Learning to Rank algorithm were provided at
      http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/ProtDec-LTR/home/ CONTACT:

TI  - Nora: A Vocabulary Discovery Tool for Concept Extraction.
PG  - 179-82
AB  - Coverage of terms in domain-specific terminologies and ontologies is often
      limited in controlled medical vocabularies. Creating and augmenting such
      terminologies is resource intensive. We developed Nora as an interactive tool to 
      discover terminology from text corpora; the output can then be employed to refine
      and enhance natural language processing-based concept extraction tasks. Nora
      provides a visualization of chains of words foraged from word frequency indexes
      from a text corpus. Domain experts direct and curate chains that contain relevant
      terms, which are further curated to identify lexical variants. A test of Nora
      demonstrated an increase of a domain lexicon in homelessness and related
      psychosocial factors by 38%, yielding an additional 10% extracted concepts.

TI  - Augmented Robotics Dialog System for Enhancing Human-Robot Interaction.
PG  - 15799-829
LID - 10.3390/s150715799 [doi]
AB  - Augmented reality, augmented television and second screen are cutting edge
      technologies that provide end users extra and enhanced information related to
      certain events in real time. This enriched information helps users better
      understand such events, at the same time providing a more satisfactory
      experience. In the present paper, we apply this main idea to human-robot
      interaction (HRI), to how users and robots interchange information. The ultimate 
      goal of this paper is to improve the quality of HRI, developing a new dialog
      manager system that incorporates enriched information from the semantic web. This
      work presents the augmented robotic dialog system (ARDS), which uses natural
      language understanding mechanisms to provide two features: (i) a non-grammar
      multimodal input (verbal and/or written) text; and (ii) a contextualization of
      the information conveyed in the interaction. This contextualization is achieved
      by information enrichment techniques that link the extracted information from the
      dialog with extra information about the world available in semantic knowledge
      bases. This enriched or contextualized information (information enrichment,
      semantic enhancement or contextualized information are used interchangeably in
      the rest of this paper) offers many possibilities in terms of HRI. For instance, 
      it can enhance the robot's pro-activeness during a human-robot dialog (the
      enriched information can be used to propose new topics during the dialog, while
      ensuring a coherent interaction). Another possibility is to display additional
      multimedia content related to the enriched information on a visual device. This
      paper describes the ARDS and shows a proof of concept of its applications.

AB  - Electronically stored clinical documents may contain both structured data and
      unstructured data. The use of structured clinical data varies by facility, but
      clinicians are familiar with coded data such as International Classification of
      Diseases, Ninth Revision, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms
      codes, and commonly other data including patient chief complaints or laboratory
      results. Most electronic health records have much more clinical information
      stored as unstructured data, for example, clinical narrative such as history of
      present illness, procedure notes, and clinical decision making are stored as
      unstructured data. Despite the importance of this information, electronic capture
      or retrieval of unstructured clinical data has been challenging. The field of
      natural language processing (NLP) is undergoing rapid development, and existing
      tools can be successfully used for quality improvement, research, healthcare
      coding, and even billing compliance. In this brief review, we provide examples of
      successful uses of NLP using emergency medicine physician visit notes for various
      projects and the challenges of retrieving specific data and finally present
      practical methods that can run on a standard personal computer as well as
      high-end state-of-the-art funded processes run by leading NLP informatics
      researchers.

TI  - Combining glass box and black box evaluations in the identification of heart
      disease risk factors and their temporal relations from clinical records.
PG  - S133-42
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2015.06.014 [doi]
LID - S1532-0464(15)00124-0 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The determination of risk factors and their temporal relations in
      natural language patient records is a complex task which has been addressed in
      the i2b2/UTHealth 2014 shared task. In this context, in most systems it was
      broadly decomposed into two sub-tasks implemented by two components: entity
      detection, and temporal relation determination. Task-level ("black box")
      evaluation is relevant for the final clinical application, whereas
      component-level evaluation ("glass box") is important for system development and 
      progress monitoring. Unfortunately, because of the interaction between entity
      representation and temporal relation representation, glass box and black box
      evaluation cannot be managed straightforwardly at the same time in the setting of
      the i2b2/UTHealth 2014 task, making it difficult to assess reliably the relative 
      performance and contribution of the individual components to the overall task.
      OBJECTIVE: To identify obstacles and propose methods to cope with this
      difficulty, and illustrate them through experiments on the i2b2/UTHealth 2014
      dataset. METHODS: We outline several solutions to this problem and examine their 
      requirements in terms of adequacy for component-level and task-level evaluation
      and of changes to the task framework. We select the solution which requires the
      least modifications to the i2b2 evaluation framework and illustrate it with our
      system. This system identifies risk factor mentions with a CRF system
      complemented by hand-designed patterns, identifies and normalizes temporal
      expressions through a tailored version of the Heideltime tool, and determines
      temporal relations of each risk factor with a One Rule classifier. RESULTS:
      Giving a fixed value to the temporal attribute in risk factor identification
      proved to be the simplest way to evaluate the risk factor detection component
      independently. This evaluation method enabled us to identify the risk factor
      detection component as most contributing to the false negatives and false
      positives of the global system. This led us to redirect further effort to this
      component, focusing on medication detection, with gains of 7 to 20 recall points 
      and of 3 to 6 F-measure points depending on the corpus and evaluation.
      CONCLUSION: We proposed a method to achieve a clearer glass box evaluation of
      risk factor detection and temporal relation detection in clinical texts, which
      can provide an example to help system development in similar tasks. This glass
      box evaluation was instrumental in refocusing our efforts and obtaining
      substantial improvements in risk factor detection.

AB  - The advances achieved in Natural Language Processing make it possible to
      automatically mine information from electronically created documents. Many
      Natural Language Processing methods that extract information from texts make use 
      of annotated corpora, but these are scarce in the clinical domain due to legal
      and ethical issues. In this paper we present the creation of the IxaMed-GS gold
      standard composed of real electronic health records written in Spanish and
      manually annotated by experts in pharmacology and pharmacovigilance. The experts 
      mainly annotated entities related to diseases and drugs, but also relationships
      between entities indicating adverse drug reaction events. To help the experts in 
      the annotation task, we adapted a general corpus linguistic analyzer to the
      medical domain. The quality of the annotation process in the IxaMed-GS corpus has
      been assessed by measuring the inter-annotator agreement, which was 90.53% for
      entities and 82.86% for events. In addition, the corpus has been used for the
      automatic extraction of adverse drug reaction events using machine learning.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires the capture and
      analysis of data from disparate sources, often from a variety of institutions
      with diverse electronic health record (EHR) implementations. In this paper we
      describe the CER Hub, a web-based informatics platform for developing and
      conducting research studies that combine comprehensive electronic clinical data
      from multiple health care organizations. METHODS: The CER Hub platform implements
      a data processing pipeline that employs informatics standards for data
      representation and web-based tools for developing study-specific data processing 
      applications, providing standardized access to the patient-centric electronic
      health record (EHR) across organizations. RESULTS: The CER Hub is being used to
      conduct two CER studies utilizing data from six geographically distributed and
      demographically diverse health systems. These foundational studies address the
      effectiveness of medications for controlling asthma and the effectiveness of
      smoking cessation services delivered in primary care. DISCUSSION: The CER Hub
      includes four key capabilities: the ability to process and analyze both free-text
      and coded clinical data in the EHR; a data processing environment supported by
      distributed data and study governance processes; a clinical data-interchange
      format for facilitating standardized extraction of clinical data from EHRs; and a
      library of shareable clinical data processing applications. CONCLUSION: CER
      requires coordinated and scalable methods for extracting, aggregating, and
      analyzing complex, multi-institutional clinical data. By offering a range of
      informatics tools integrated into a framework for conducting studies using EHR
      data, the CER Hub provides a solution to the challenges of multi-institutional
      research using electronic medical record data.

TI  - Collecting and Analyzing Patient Experiences of Health Care From Social Media.
PG  - e78

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social Media, such as Yelp, provides rich information of consumer
      experience. Previous studies suggest that Yelp can serve as a new source to study
      patient experience. However, the lack of a corpus of patient reviews causes a
      major bottleneck for applying computational techniques. OBJECTIVE: The objective 
      of this study is to create a corpus of patient experience (COPE) and report
      descriptive statistics to characterize COPE. METHODS: Yelp reviews about health
      care-related businesses were extracted from the Yelp Academic Dataset. Natural
      language processing (NLP) tools were used to split reviews into sentences,
      extract noun phrases and adjectives from each sentence, and generate parse trees 
      and dependency trees for each sentence. Sentiment analysis techniques and Hadoop 
      were used to calculate a sentiment score of each sentence and for parallel
      processing, respectively. RESULTS: COPE contains 79,173 sentences from 6914
      patient reviews of 985 health care facilities near 30 universities in the United 
      States. We found that patients wrote longer reviews when they rated the facility 
      poorly (1 or 2 stars). We demonstrated that the computed sentiment scores
      correlated well with consumer-generated ratings. A consumer vocabulary to
      describe their health care experience was constructed by a statistical analysis
      of word counts and co-occurrences in COPE. CONCLUSIONS: A corpus called COPE was 
      built as an initial step to utilize social media to understand patient
      experiences at health care facilities. The corpus is available to download and
      COPE can be used in future studies to extract knowledge of patients' experiences 
      from their perspectives. Such information can subsequently inform and provide
      opportunity to improve the quality of health care.

      notes.

AB  - Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally and a significant part of
      the human population lives with it. A number of risk factors have been recognized
      as contributing to the disease, including obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD),
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and family history of premature 
      CAD. This paper describes and evaluates a methodology to extract mentions of such
      risk factors from diabetic clinical notes, which was a task of the i2b2/UTHealth 
      2014 Challenge in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data. The methodology 
      is knowledge-driven and the system implements local lexicalized rules (based on
      syntactical patterns observed in notes) combined with manually constructed
      dictionaries that characterize the domain. A part of the task was also to detect 
      the time interval in which the risk factors were present in a patient. The system
      was applied to an evaluation set of 514 unseen notes and achieved a micro-average
      F-score of 88% (with 86% precision and 90% recall). While the identification of
      CAD family history, medication and some of the related disease factors (e.g.
      hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) showed quite good results, the
      identification of CAD-specific indicators proved to be more challenging (F-score 
      of 74%). Overall, the results are encouraging and suggested that automated text
      mining methods can be used to process clinical notes to identify risk factors and
      monitor progression of heart disease on a large-scale, providing necessary data
      for clinical and epidemiological studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide an editorial introduction to the 2015 IMIA Yearbook of
      Medical Informatics. METHODS: We provide a brief overview of the 2015 special
      topic "Patient-Centered Care Coordination", discuss the addition of two new
      sections to the Yearbook, Natural Language Processing and Public Health &
      Epidemiology Informatics, and present our editorial plans for the upcoming
      celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Yearbook. RESULTS: Care delivery
      currently occurs through the processing of complex clinical pathways designed for
      increasingly multi-morbid patients by various practitioners in different
      settings. To avoid the consequences of the fragmentation of services, care should
      be organized to coordinate all providers, giving them the opportunity to share
      the same holistic view of the patient's condition, and to be informed of the
      planned clinical pathway that establishes the roles and interventions of each
      one. The adoption and use of electronic health records (EHRs) is a solution to
      address health information sharing and care coordination challenges. However,
      while EHRs are necessary, they are not sufficient to achieve care coordination,
      creating information availability does not mean the information will be accessed.
      This edition of the Yearbook acknowledges the fact that health information
      technology (HIT), and EHRs in particular, are not yet fully addressing the
      challenges in care coordination. Emerging trends, tools, and applications of HIT 
      to support care coordination are presented through the keynote paper, survey
      papers, and working group contributions. CONCLUSIONS: In 2015, the IMIA Yearbook 
      has been extended to emphasize two fields of biomedical informatics through new
      sections. Next year, the 25th anniversary of the Yearbook will be celebrated in
      grand style! A special issue with a touch of reflection, a bit of rediscovery,
      and some "science-fiction" will be published in addition to the usual edition.

AB  - This paper describes a supervised machine learning approach for identifying heart
      disease risk factors in clinical text, and assessing the impact of annotation
      granularity and quality on the system's ability to recognize these risk factors. 
      We utilize a series of support vector machine models in conjunction with manually
      built lexicons to classify triggers specific to each risk factor. The features
      used for classification were quite simple, utilizing only lexical information and
      ignoring higher-level linguistic information such as syntax and semantics.
      Instead, we incorporated high-quality data to train the models by annotating
      additional information on top of a standard corpus. Despite the relative
      simplicity of the system, it achieves the highest scores (micro- and macro-F1,
      and micro- and macro-recall) out of the 20 participants in the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth
      Shared Task. This system obtains a micro- (macro-) precision of 0.8951 (0.8965), 
      recall of 0.9625 (0.9611), and F1-measure of 0.9276 (0.9277). Additionally, we
      perform a series of experiments to assess the value of the annotated data we
      created. These experiments show how manually-labeled negative annotations can
      improve information extraction performance, demonstrating the importance of
      high-quality, fine-grained natural language annotations.

AB  - De-identification, identifying and removing all protected health information
      (PHI) present in clinical data including electronic medical records (EMRs), is a 
      critical step in making clinical data publicly available. The 2014 i2b2 (Center
      of Informatics for Integrating Biology and Bedside) clinical natural language
      processing (NLP) challenge sets up a track for de-identification (track 1). In
      this study, we propose a hybrid system based on both machine learning and rule
      approaches for the de-identification track. In our system, PHI instances are
      first identified by two (token-level and character-level) conditional random
      fields (CRFs) and a rule-based classifier, and then are merged by some rules.
      Experiments conducted on the i2b2 corpus show that our system submitted for the
      challenge achieves the highest micro F-scores of 94.64%, 91.24% and 91.63% under 
      the "token", "strict" and "relaxed" criteria respectively, which is among
      top-ranked systems of the 2014 i2b2 challenge. After integrating some refined
      localization dictionaries, our system is further improved with F-scores of
      94.83%, 91.57% and 91.95% under the "token", "strict" and "relaxed" criteria
      respectively.

AB  - Control vector parameterization (CVP) is an important approach of the engineering
      optimization for the industrial dynamic processes. However, its major defect, the
      low optimization efficiency caused by calculating the relevant differential
      equations in the generated nonlinear programming (NLP) problem repeatedly, limits
      its wide application in the engineering optimization for the industrial dynamic
      processes. A novel highly effective control parameterization approach, fast-CVP, 
      is first proposed to improve the optimization efficiency for industrial dynamic
      processes, where the costate gradient formulae is employed and a fast approximate
      scheme is presented to solve the differential equations in dynamic process
      simulation. Three well-known engineering optimization benchmark problems of the
      industrial dynamic processes are demonstrated as illustration. The research
      results show that the proposed fast approach achieves a fine performance that at 
      least 90% of the computation time can be saved in contrast to the traditional CVP
      method, which reveals the effectiveness of the proposed fast engineering
      optimization approach for the industrial dynamic processes.

TI  - The Effect of a Brief Intervention for Patients with Ischemic Stroke: A

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common after stroke. There is inconclusive
      evidence of the benefit of psychotherapy for poststroke depression and anxiety.
      Here, we used a brief intervention, Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) brief
      therapy plus health education, to evaluate the changes in patients with ischemic 
      stroke. METHODS: One hundred eighty patients were randomly allocated to receive 4
      sessions of NLP plus health education (n = 90) or usual care (n = 90). A set of
      questionnaires was used preintervention and postintervention as well as at the
      6-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of depression and
      anxiety, and the awareness of stroke knowledge. RESULTS: More patients in the
      intervention group achieved remission of depressive (odds ratio [OR], 2.81; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.41-5.59) and anxious symptoms (OR, 2.19; 95% CI,
      1.15-4.18) after intervention. At the 6-month follow-up, we found no differences 
      between groups in both the prevalence of depression and anxiety. After
      intervention, the intervention group had better awareness rates on most of the
      stroke knowledge items (P < .05). It also had better quality of life and physical
      function both after intervention and at the follow-up (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: NLP
      plus health education could reduce depression and anxiety immediately after
      intervention, but not at the 6-month follow-up. The intervention could also
      improve the awareness of stroke knowledge and benefit patients on quality of life
      and physical function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Drug named entity recognition (NER) is a critical step for complex
      biomedical NLP tasks such as the extraction of pharmacogenomic, pharmacodynamic
      and pharmacokinetic parameters. Large quantities of high quality training data
      are almost always a prerequisite for employing supervised machine-learning
      techniques to achieve high classification performance. However, the human labour 
      needed to produce and maintain such resources is a significant limitation. In
      this study, we improve the performance of drug NER without relying exclusively on
      manual annotations. METHODS: We perform drug NER using either a small
      gold-standard corpus (120 abstracts) or no corpus at all. In our approach, we
      develop a voting system to combine a number of heterogeneous models, based on
      dictionary knowledge, gold-standard corpora and silver annotations, to enhance
      performance. To improve recall, we employed genetic programming to evolve 11
      regular-expression patterns that capture common drug suffixes and used them as an
      extra means for recognition. MATERIALS: Our approach uses a dictionary of drug
      names, i.e. DrugBank, a small manually annotated corpus, i.e. the pharmacokinetic
      corpus, and a part of the UKPMC database, as raw biomedical text. Gold-standard
      and silver annotated data are used to train maximum entropy and multinomial
      logistic regression classifiers. RESULTS: Aggregating drug NER methods, based on 
      gold-standard annotations, dictionary knowledge and patterns, improved the
      performance on models trained on gold-standard annotations, only, achieving a
      maximum F-score of 95%. In addition, combining models trained on silver
      annotations, dictionary knowledge and patterns are shown to achieve comparable
      performance to models trained exclusively on gold-standard data. The main reason 
      appears to be the morphological similarities shared among drug names. CONCLUSION:
      We conclude that gold-standard data are not a hard requirement for drug NER.
      Combining heterogeneous models build on dictionary knowledge can achieve similar 
      or comparable classification performance with that of the best performing model
      trained on gold-standard annotations.

      Measurement, Quality, and Outcomes.
PG  - 1299-305
LID - 10.1111/jgs.13491 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use natural language processing (NLP) of text from electronic
      medical records (EMRs) to identify failed communication attempts between home
      health nurses and physicians, to identify predictors of communication failure,
      and to assess the association between communication failure and hospital
      readmission. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Visiting Nurse Service 
      of New York (VNSNY), the nation's largest freestanding home health agency.
      PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries with congestive heart failure who received
      home health care from VNSNY after hospital discharge in 2008-09 (N = 5,698).
      MEASUREMENTS: Patient-level measures of communication failure and risk-adjusted
      30-day all-cause readmission. RESULTS: Identification of failed communication
      attempts using NLP had high external validity (kappa = 0.850, P < .001). A mean
      of 8% of communication attempts failed per episode of home care; failure rates
      were higher for black patients and lower for patients from higher median income
      ZIP codes. The association between communication failure and readmission was not 
      significant with adjustment for patient, nurse, physician, and hospital factors. 
      CONCLUSION: NLP of EMRs can be used to identify failed communication attempts
      between home health nurses and physicians, but other variables mostly explained
      the association between communication failure and readmission. Communication
      failures may contribute to readmissions in more-serious clinical situations, an
      association that this study may have been underpowered to detect.

TI  - Social network analysis of mating patterns in American black bears (Ursus
      americanus).
PG  - 4010-22
LID - 10.1111/mec.13290 [doi]
AB  - Nonrandom mating can structure populations and has important implications for
      population-level processes. Investigating how and why mating deviates from random
      is important for understanding evolutionary processes as well as informing
      conservation and management. Prior to the implementation of parentage analyses,
      understanding mating patterns in solitary, elusive species like bears was
      virtually impossible. Here, we capitalize on a long-term genetic data set
      collected from black bears (Ursus americanus) (N = 2422) in the Northern Lower
      Peninsula (NLP) of Michigan, USA. We identified mated pairs using parentage
      analysis and applied logistic regression (selection) models that controlled for
      features of the social network, to quantify the effects of individual
      characteristics, and spatial and population demographic factors on mating
      dynamics. Logistic regression models revealed that black bear mating was
      associated with spatial proximity of mates, male age, the time a pair had
      coexisted, local population density and relatedness. Mated pairs were more likely
      to contain older males. On average, bears tended to mate with nearby individuals 
      to whom they were related, which does not support the existence of kin
      recognition in black bears. Pairwise relatedness was especially high for mated
      pairs containing young males. Restricted dispersal and high male turnover from
      intensive harvest mortality of NLP black bears are probably the underlying
      factors associated with younger male bears mating more often with female
      relatives. Our findings illustrate how harvest has the potential to disrupt the
      social structure of game species, which warrants further attention for
      conservation and management.

TI  - A Fuzzy Computing Model for Identifying Polarity of Chinese Sentiment Words.
PG  - 525437
LID - 10.1155/2015/525437 [doi]
AB  - With the spurt of online user-generated contents on web, sentiment analysis has
      become a very active research issue in data mining and natural language
      processing. As the most important indicator of sentiment, sentiment words which
      convey positive and negative polarity are quite instrumental for sentiment
      analysis. However, most of the existing methods for identifying polarity of
      sentiment words only consider the positive and negative polarity by the Cantor
      set, and no attention is paid to the fuzziness of the polarity intensity of
      sentiment words. In order to improve the performance, we propose a fuzzy
      computing model to identify the polarity of Chinese sentiment words in this
      paper. There are three major contributions in this paper. Firstly, we propose a
      method to compute polarity intensity of sentiment morphemes and sentiment words. 
      Secondly, we construct a fuzzy sentiment classifier and propose two different
      methods to compute the parameter of the fuzzy classifier. Thirdly, we conduct
      extensive experiments on four sentiment words datasets and three review datasets,
      and the experimental results indicate that our model performs better than the
      state-of-the-art methods.

      neurophysiological models.
PG  - 135
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2015.00135 [doi]
AB  - Computer programs that can accurately interpret natural human language and carry 
      out instructions would improve the lives of people with language processing
      deficits and greatly benefit society in general. von Neumann in theorized that
      the human brain utilizes its own unique statistical neuronal computation to
      decode language and that this produces specific patterns of neuronal activity.
      This paper extends von Neumann's theory to the processing of partial semantics of
      declarative sentences. I developed semantic neuronal network models that emulate 
      key features of cortical language processing and accurately compute partial
      semantics of English sentences. The method of computation implements the MAYA
      Semantic Technique, a mathematical technique I previously developed to determine 
      partial semantics of sentences within a natural language processing program. Here
      I further simplified the technique by grouping repeating patterns into fewer
      categories. Unlike other natural language programs, my approach computes three
      partial semantics. The results of this research show that the computation of
      partial semantics of a sentence uses both feedforward and feedback projection
      which suggest that the partial semantic presented in this research might be a
      conscious activity within the human brain.

TI  - RobotReviewer: evaluation of a system for automatically assessing bias in
      clinical trials.
PG  - 193-201
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv044 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate RobotReviewer, a machine learning (ML) system 
      that automatically assesses bias in clinical trials. From a (PDF-formatted) trial
      report, the system should determine risks of bias for the domains defined by the 
      Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, and extract supporting text for these
      judgments. METHODS: We algorithmically annotated 12,808 trial PDFs using data
      from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Trials were labeled as
      being at low or high/unclear risk of bias for each domain, and sentences were
      labeled as being informative or not. This dataset was used to train a multi-task 
      ML model. We estimated the accuracy of ML judgments versus humans by comparing
      trials with two or more independent RoB assessments in the CDSR. Twenty blinded
      experienced reviewers rated the relevance of supporting text, comparing ML output
      with equivalent (human-extracted) text from the CDSR. RESULTS: By retrieving the 
      top 3 candidate sentences per document (top3 recall), the best ML text was rated 
      more relevant than text from the CDSR, but not significantly (60.4% ML text rated
      'highly relevant' v 56.5% of text from reviews; difference +3.9%, [-3.2% to
      +10.9%]). Model RoB judgments were less accurate than those from published
      reviews, though the difference was <10% (overall accuracy 71.0% with ML v 78.3%
      with CDSR). CONCLUSION: Risk of bias assessment may be automated with reasonable 
      accuracy. Automatically identified text supporting bias assessment is of equal
      quality to the manually identified text in the CDSR. This technology could
      substantially reduce reviewer workload and expedite evidence syntheses.

PG  - S5

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT)
      is officially released in English and Spanish. In the Basque Autonomous Community
      two languages, Spanish and Basque, are official. The first attempt to
      semi-automatically translate the SNOMED CT terminology content to Basque, a less 
      resourced language is presented in this paper. METHODS: A translation algorithm
      that has its basis in Natural Language Processing methods has been designed and
      partially implemented. The algorithm comprises four phases from which the first
      two have been implemented and quantitatively evaluated. RESULTS: Results are
      promising as we obtained the equivalents in Basque of 21.41% of the disorder
      terms of the English SNOMED CT release. As the methods developed are focused on
      that hierarchy, the results in other hierarchies are lower (12.57% for body
      structure descriptions, 8.80% for findings and 3% for procedures). CONCLUSIONS:
      We are in the way to reach two of our objectives when translating SNOMED CT to
      Basque: to use our language to access rich multilingual resources and to
      strengthen the use of the Basque language in the biomedical area.

TI  - Profiling School Shooters: Automatic Text-Based Analysis.
PG  - 86
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00086 [doi]
AB  - School shooters present a challenge to both forensic psychiatry and law
      enforcement agencies. The relatively small number of school shooters, their
      various characteristics, and the lack of in-depth analysis of all of the shooters
      prior to the shooting add complexity to our understanding of this problem. In
      this short paper, we introduce a new methodology for automatically profiling
      school shooters. The methodology involves automatic analysis of texts and the
      production of several measures relevant for the identification of the shooters.
      Comparing texts written by 6 school shooters to 6056 texts written by a
      comparison group of male subjects, we found that the shooters' texts scored
      significantly higher on the Narcissistic Personality dimension as well as on the 
      Humilated and Revengeful dimensions. Using a ranking/prioritization procedure,
      similar to the one used for the automatic identification of sexual predators, we 
      provide support for the validity and relevance of the proposed methodology.

TI  - Automatic target validation based on neuroscientific literature mining for
      tractography.
PG  - 66
LID - 10.3389/fnana.2015.00066 [doi]
AB  - Target identification for tractography studies requires solid anatomical
      knowledge validated by an extensive literature review across species for each
      seed structure to be studied. Manual literature review to identify targets for a 
      given seed region is tedious and potentially subjective. Therefore, complementary
      approaches would be useful. We propose to use text-mining models to automatically
      suggest potential targets from the neuroscientific literature, full-text articles
      and abstracts, so that they can be used for anatomical connection studies and
      more specifically for tractography. We applied text-mining models to three
      structures: two well-studied structures, since validated deep brain stimulation
      targets, the internal globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus and, the
      nucleus accumbens, an exploratory target for treating psychiatric disorders. We
      performed a systematic review of the literature to document the projections of
      the three selected structures and compared it with the targets proposed by
      text-mining models, both in rat and primate (including human). We ran
      probabilistic tractography on the nucleus accumbens and compared the output with 
      the results of the text-mining models and literature review. Overall, text-mining
      the literature could find three times as many targets as two man-weeks of
      curation could. The overall efficiency of the text-mining against literature
      review in our study was 98% recall (at 36% precision), meaning that over all the 
      targets for the three selected seeds, only one target has been missed by
      text-mining. We demonstrate that connectivity for a structure of interest can be 
      extracted from a very large amount of publications and abstracts. We believe this
      tool will be useful in helping the neuroscience community to facilitate
      connectivity studies of particular brain regions. The text mining tools used for 
      the study are part of the HBP Neuroinformatics Platform, publicly available at
      http://connectivity-brainer.rhcloud.com/.

TI  - Automating data extraction in systematic reviews: a systematic review.
PG  - 78
LID - 10.1186/s13643-015-0066-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automation of the parts of systematic review process, specifically
      the data extraction step, may be an important strategy to reduce the time
      necessary to complete a systematic review. However, the state of the science of
      automatically extracting data elements from full texts has not been well
      described. This paper performs a systematic review of published and unpublished
      methods to automate data extraction for systematic reviews. METHODS: We
      systematically searched PubMed, IEEEXplore, and ACM Digital Library to identify
      potentially relevant articles. We included reports that met the following
      criteria: 1) methods or results section described what entities were or need to
      be extracted, and 2) at least one entity was automatically extracted with
      evaluation results that were presented for that entity. We also reviewed the
      citations from included reports. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1190 unique citations
      that met our search criteria, we found 26 published reports describing automatic 
      extraction of at least one of more than 52 potential data elements used in
      systematic reviews. For 25 (48 %) of the data elements used in systematic
      reviews, there were attempts from various researchers to extract information
      automatically from the publication text. Out of these, 14 (27 %) data elements
      were completely extracted, but the highest number of data elements extracted
      automatically by a single study was 7. Most of the data elements were extracted
      with F-scores (a mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value) of over 70 %.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found no unified information extraction framework tailored to the
      systematic review process, and published reports focused on a limited (1-7)
      number of data elements. Biomedical natural language processing techniques have
      not been fully utilized to fully or even partially automate the data extraction
      step of systematic reviews.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) are being increasingly utilized and form a
      unique source of extensive data gathered during routine clinical care. Through
      use of codified and free text concepts identified using clinical informatics
      tools, disease labels can be assigned with a high degree of accuracy. Analysis
      linking such EHR-assigned disease labels to a biospecimen repository has
      demonstrated that genetic associations identified in prospective cohorts can be
      replicated with adequate statistical power and novel phenotypic associations
      identified. In addition, genetic discovery research can be performed utilizing
      clinical, laboratory, and procedure data obtained during care. Challenges with
      such research include the need to tackle variability in quality and quantity of
      EHR data and importance of maintaining patient privacy and data security. With
      appropriate safeguards, this novel and emerging field of research offers
      considerable promise and potential to further scientific research in
      gastroenterology efficiently, cost-effectively, and with engagement of patients
      and communities.

TI  - Phenome-driven disease genetics prediction toward drug discovery.
PG  - i276-83
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv245 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Discerning genetic contributions to diseases not only enhances our
      understanding of disease mechanisms, but also leads to translational
      opportunities for drug discovery. Recent computational approaches incorporate
      disease phenotypic similarities to improve the prediction power of disease gene
      discovery. However, most current studies used only one data source of human
      disease phenotype. We present an innovative and generic strategy for combining
      multiple different data sources of human disease phenotype and predicting
      disease-associated genes from integrated phenotypic and genomic data. RESULTS: To
      demonstrate our approach, we explored a new phenotype database from biomedical
      ontologies and constructed Disease Manifestation Network (DMN). We combined DMN
      with mimMiner, which was a widely used phenotype database in disease gene
      prediction studies. Our approach achieved significantly improved performance over
      a baseline method, which used only one phenotype data source. In the
      leave-one-out cross-validation and de novo gene prediction analysis, our approach
      achieved the area under the curves of 90.7% and 90.3%, which are significantly
      higher than 84.2% (P < e(-4)) and 81.3% (P < e(-12)) for the baseline approach.
      We further demonstrated that our predicted genes have the translational potential
      in drug discovery. We used Crohn's disease as an example and ranked the candidate
      drugs based on the rank of drug targets. Our gene prediction approach prioritized
      druggable genes that are likely to be associated with Crohn's disease
      pathogenesis, and our rank of candidate drugs successfully prioritized the Food
      and Drug Administration-approved drugs for Crohn's disease. We also found
      literature evidence to support a number of drugs among the top 200 candidates. In
      summary, we demonstrated that a novel strategy combining unique disease phenotype
      data with system approaches can lead to rapid drug discovery. AVAILABILITY AND

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of medical trainee learning through pre-defined
      competencies is now commonplace in schools of medicine. We describe a novel
      electronic advisor system using natural language processing (NLP) to identify two
      geriatric medicine competencies from medical student clinical notes in the
      electronic medical record: advance directives (AD) and altered mental status
      (AMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical notes from third year medical students
      were processed using a general-purpose NLP system to identify biomedical concepts
      and their section context. The system analyzed these notes for relevance to AD or
      AMS and generated custom email alerts to students with embedded supplemental
      learning material customized to their notes. Recall and precision of the two
      advisors were evaluated by physician review. Students were given pre and post
      multiple choice question tests broadly covering geriatrics. RESULTS: Of 102
      students approached, 66 students consented and enrolled. The system sent 393
      email alerts to 54 students (82%), including 270 for AD and 123 for AMS.
      Precision was 100% for AD and 93% for AMS. Recall was 69% for AD and 100% for
      AMS. Students mentioned ADs for 43 patients, with all mentions occurring after
      first having received an AD reminder. Students accessed educational links 34
      times from the 393 email alerts. There was no difference in pre (mean 62%) and
      post (mean 60%) test scores. CONCLUSIONS: The system effectively identified two
      educational opportunities using NLP applied to clinical notes and demonstrated a 
      small change in student behavior. Use of electronic advisors such as these may
      provide a scalable model to assess specific competency elements and deliver
      educational opportunities.

TI  - Domain adaptation for semantic role labeling of clinical text.
PG  - 967-79
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocu048 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Semantic role labeling (SRL), which extracts a shallow semantic
      relation representation from different surface textual forms of free text
      sentences, is important for understanding natural language. Few studies in SRL
      have been conducted in the medical domain, primarily due to lack of annotated
      clinical SRL corpora, which are time-consuming and costly to build. The goal of
      this study is to investigate domain adaptation techniques for clinical SRL
      leveraging resources built from newswire and biomedical literature to improve
      performance and save annotation costs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multisource
      Integrated Platform for Answering Clinical Questions (MiPACQ), a manually
      annotated SRL clinical corpus, was used as the target domain dataset. PropBank
      and NomBank from newswire and BioProp from biomedical literature were used as
      source domain datasets. Three state-of-the-art domain adaptation algorithms were 
      employed: instance pruning, transfer self-training, and feature augmentation. The
      SRL performance using different domain adaptation algorithms was evaluated by
      using 10-fold cross-validation on the MiPACQ corpus. Learning curves for the
      different methods were generated to assess the effect of sample size. RESULTS AND
      CONCLUSION: When all three source domain corpora were used, the feature
      augmentation algorithm achieved statistically significant higher F-measure
      (83.18%), compared to the baseline with MiPACQ dataset alone (F-measure, 81.53%),
      indicating that domain adaptation algorithms may improve SRL performance on
      clinical text. To achieve a comparable performance to the baseline method that
      used 90% of MiPACQ training samples, the feature augmentation algorithm required 
      <50% of training samples in MiPACQ, demonstrating that annotation costs of
      clinical SRL can be reduced significantly by leveraging existing SRL resources
      from other domains.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Automatically identifying specific phenotypes in free-text clinical
      notes is critically important for the reuse of clinical data. In this study, the 
      authors combine expert-guided feature (text) selection with one-class
      classification for text processing. OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance of
      one-class classification to traditional binary classification; to evaluate the
      utility of feature selection based on expert-selected salient text (snippets);
      and to determine the robustness of these models with respects to irrelevant
      surrounding text. METHODS: The authors trained one-class support vector machines 
      (1C-SVMs) and two-class SVMs (2C-SVMs) to identify notes discussing breast
      cancer. Manually annotated visit summary notes (88 positive and 88 negative for
      breast cancer) were used to compare the performance of models trained on whole
      notes labeled as positive or negative to models trained on expert-selected text
      sections (snippets) relevant to breast cancer status. Model performance was
      evaluated using a 70:30 split for 20 iterations and on a realistic dataset of 10 
      000 records with a breast cancer prevalence of 1.4%. RESULTS: When tested on a
      balanced experimental dataset, 1C-SVMs trained on snippets had comparable results
      to 2C-SVMs trained on whole notes (F = 0.92 for both approaches). When evaluated 
      on a realistic imbalanced dataset, 1C-SVMs had a considerably superior
      performance (F = 0.61 vs. F = 0.17 for the best performing model) attributable
      mainly to improved precision (p = .88 vs. p = .09 for the best performing model).
      CONCLUSIONS: 1C-SVMs trained on expert-selected relevant text sections perform
      better than 2C-SVMs classifiers trained on either snippets or whole notes when
      applied to realistically imbalanced data with low prevalence of the positive
      class.

TI  - Semantic retrieval and navigation in clinical document collections.
PG  - 9-14
AB  - Patients with chronic diseases undergo numerous in- and outpatient treatment
      periods, and therefore many documents accumulate in their electronic records. We 
      report on an on-going project focussing on the semantic enrichment of medical
      texts, in order to support recall-oriented navigation across a patient's complete
      documentation. A document pool of 1,696 de-identified discharge summaries was
      used for prototyping. A natural language processing toolset for document
      annotation (based on the text-mining framework UIMA) and indexing (Solr) was used
      to support a browser-based platform for document import, search and navigation.
      The integrated search engine combines free text and concept-based querying,
      supported by dynamically generated facets (diagnoses, procedures, medications,
      lab values, and body parts). The prototype demonstrates the feasibility of
      semantic document enrichment within document collections of a single patient.
      Originally conceived as an add-on for the clinical workplace, this technology
      could also be adapted to support personalised health record platforms, as well as
      cross-patient search for cohort building and other secondary use scenarios.

TI  - Incorporating advanced language models into the P300 speller using particle
      filtering.
PG  - 046018
LID - 10.1088/1741-2560/12/4/046018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The P300 speller is a common brain-computer interface (BCI)
      application designed to communicate language by detecting event related
      potentials in a subject's electroencephalogram signal. Information about the
      structure of natural language can be valuable for BCI communication, but attempts
      to use this information have thus far been limited to rudimentary n-gram models. 
      While more sophisticated language models are prevalent in natural language
      processing literature, current BCI analysis methods based on dynamic programming 
      cannot handle their complexity. APPROACH: Sampling methods can overcome this
      complexity by estimating the posterior distribution without searching the entire 
      state space of the model. In this study, we implement sequential importance
      resampling, a commonly used particle filtering (PF) algorithm, to integrate a
      probabilistic automaton language model. MAIN RESULT: This method was first
      evaluated offline on a dataset of 15 healthy subjects, which showed significant
      increases in speed and accuracy when compared to standard classification methods 
      as well as a recently published approach using a hidden Markov model (HMM). An
      online pilot study verified these results as the average speed and accuracy
      achieved using the PF method was significantly higher than that using the HMM
      method. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings strongly support the integration of
      domain-specific knowledge into BCI classification to improve system performance.

AB  - We describe the WhiteText project, and its progress towards automatically
      extracting statements of neuroanatomical connectivity from text. We review
      progress to date on the three main steps of the project: recognition of brain
      region mentions, standardization of brain region mentions to neuroanatomical
      nomenclature, and connectivity statement extraction. We further describe a new
      version of our manually curated corpus that adds 2,111 connectivity statements
      from 1,828 additional abstracts. Cross-validation classification within the new
      corpus replicates results on our original corpus, recalling 67% of connectivity
      statements at 51% precision. The resulting merged corpus provides 5,208
      connectivity statements that can be used to seed species-specific connectivity
      matrices and to better train automated techniques. Finally, we present a new web 
      application that allows fast interactive browsing of the over 70,000 sentences
      indexed by the system, as a tool for accessing the data and assisting in further 
      curation. Software and data are freely available at

PG  - S4
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-15-S1-S4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Entity Linking (EL) task links entity mentions from an
      unstructured document to entities in a knowledge base. Although this problem is
      well-studied in news and social media, this problem has not received much
      attention in the life science domain. One outcome of tackling the EL problem in
      the life sciences domain is to enable scientists to build computational models of
      biological processes with more efficiency. However, simply applying a
      news-trained entity linker produces inadequate results. METHODS: Since existing
      supervised approaches require a large amount of manually-labeled training data,
      which is currently unavailable for the life science domain, we propose a novel
      unsupervised collective inference approach to link entities from unstructured
      full texts of biomedical literature to 300 ontologies. The approach leverages the
      rich semantic information and structures in ontologies for similarity computation
      and entity ranking. RESULTS: Without using any manual annotation, our approach
      significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised EL method (9% absolute gain
      in linking accuracy). Furthermore, the state-of-the-art supervised EL method
      requires 15,000 manually annotated entity mentions for training. These promising 
      results establish a benchmark for the EL task in the life science domain. We also
      provide in depth analysis and discussion on both challenges and opportunities on 
      automatic knowledge enrichment for scientific literature. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      paper, we propose a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to address
      the EL problem in a new domain. We show that our unsupervised approach is able to
      outperform a current state-of-the-art supervised approach that has been trained
      with a large amount of manually labeled data. Life science presents an
      underrepresented domain for applying EL techniques. By providing a small
      benchmark data set and identifying opportunities, we hope to stimulate
      discussions across natural language processing and bioinformatics and motivate
      others to develop techniques for this largely untapped domain.

TI  - Parsing clinical text: how good are the state-of-the-art parsers?
PG  - S2
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-15-S1-S2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parsing, which generates a syntactic structure of a sentence (a parse
      tree), is a critical component of natural language processing (NLP) research in
      any domain including medicine. Although parsers developed in the general English 
      domain, such as the Stanford parser, have been applied to clinical text, there
      are no formal evaluations and comparisons of their performance in the medical
      domain. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the performance of three
      state-of-the-art parsers: the Stanford parser, the Bikel parser, and the Charniak
      parser, using following two datasets: (1) A Treebank containing 1,100 sentences
      that were randomly selected from progress notes used in the 2010 i2b2 NLP
      challenge and manually annotated according to a Penn Treebank based guideline;
      and (2) the MiPACQ Treebank, which is developed based on pathology notes and
      clinical notes, containing 13,091 sentences. We conducted three experiments on
      both datasets. First, we measured the performance of the three state-of-the-art
      parsers on the clinical Treebanks with their default settings. Then we re-trained
      the parsers using the clinical Treebanks and evaluated their performance using
      the 10-fold cross validation method. Finally we re-trained the parsers by
      combining the clinical Treebanks with the Penn Treebank. RESULTS: Our results
      showed that the original parsers achieved lower performance in clinical text
      (Bracketing F-measure in the range of 66.6%-70.3%) compared to general English
      text. After retraining on the clinical Treebank, all parsers achieved better
      performance, with the best performance from the Stanford parser that reached the 
      highest Bracketing F-measure of 73.68% on progress notes and 83.72% on the MiPACQ
      corpus using 10-fold cross validation. When the combined clinical Treebanks and
      Penn Treebank was used, of the three parsers, the Charniak parser achieved the
      highest Bracketing F-measure of 73.53% on progress notes and the Stanford parser 
      reached the highest F-measure of 84.15% on the MiPACQ corpus. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      study demonstrates that re-training using clinical Treebanks is critical for
      improving general English parsers' performance on clinical text, and combining
      clinical and open domain corpora might achieve optimal performance for parsing
      clinical text.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are frequently used by clinicians
      and researchers to search for, extract, and analyze groups of patients by
      defining Health Outcome of Interests (HOI). The definition of an HOI is generally
      considered a complex and time consuming task for health care professionals.
      METHODS: In our clinical note-based pharmacovigilance research, we often operate 
      upon potentially hundreds of ontologies at once, expand query inputs, and we also
      increase the search space over clinical text as well as structured data. Such a
      method implies to specify an initial set of seed concepts, which are based on
      concept unique identifiers. This paper presents a novel method based on Formal
      Concept Analysis (FCA) and Semantic Query Expansion (SQE) to assist the end-user 
      in defining their seed queries and in refining the expanded search space that it 
      encompasses. RESULTS: We evaluate our method over a gold-standard corpus from the
      2008 i2b2 Obesity Challenge. This experimentation emphasizes positive results for
      sensitivity and specificity measures. Our new approach provides better recall
      with high precision of the obtained results. The most promising aspect of this
      approach consists in the discovery of positive results not present our Obesity
      NLP reference set. CONCLUSIONS: Together with a Web graphical user interface, our
      FCA and SQE cooperation end up being an efficient approach for refining health
      outcome of interest using plain terms. We consider that this approach can be
      extended to support other domains such as cohort building tools.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Twitter can address the challenges of the current Ebola outbreak
      surveillance. The aims of this study are to demonstrate the use of Twitter as a
      real-time method of Ebola outbreak surveillance to monitor information spread,
      capture early epidemic detection, and examine content of public knowledge and
      attitudes. METHODS: We collected tweets mentioning Ebola in English during the
      early stage of the current Ebola outbreak from July 24-August 1, 2014. Our
      analysis for this observational study includes time series analysis with geologic
      visualization to observe information dissemination and content analysis using
      natural language processing to examine public knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: A
      total of 42,236 tweets (16,499 unique and 25,737 retweets) mentioning Ebola were 
      posted and disseminated to 9,362,267,048 people, 63 times higher than the initial
      number. Tweets started to rise in Nigeria 3-7 days prior to the official
      announcement of the first probable Ebola case. The topics discussed in tweets
      include risk factors, prevention education, disease trends, and compassion.
      CONCLUSION: Because of the analysis of a unique Twitter dataset captured in the
      early stage of the current Ebola outbreak, our results provide insight into the
      intersection of social media and public health outbreak surveillance. Findings
      demonstrate the usefulness of Twitter mining to inform public health education.

TI  - Automated Detection of HONcode Website Conformity Compared to Manual Detection:
      An Evaluation.
PG  - e135
LID - 10.2196/jmir.3831 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To earn HONcode certification, a website must conform to the 8
      principles of the HONcode of Conduct In the current manual process of
      certification, a HONcode expert assesses the candidate website using precise
      guidelines for each principle. In the scope of the European project KHRESMOI, the
      Health on the Net (HON) Foundation has developed an automated system to assist in
      detecting a website's HONcode conformity. Automated assistance in conducting
      HONcode reviews can expedite the current time-consuming tasks of HONcode
      certification and ongoing surveillance. Additionally, an automated tool used as a
      plugin to a general search engine might help to detect health websites that
      respect HONcode principles but have not yet been certified. OBJECTIVE: The goal
      of this study was to determine whether the automated system is capable of
      performing as good as human experts for the task of identifying HONcode
      principles on health websites. METHODS: Using manual evaluation by HONcode senior
      experts as a baseline, this study compared the capability of the automated
      HONcode detection system to that of the HONcode senior experts. A set of 27
      health-related websites were manually assessed for compliance to each of the 8
      HONcode principles by senior HONcode experts. The same set of websites were
      processed by the automated system for HONcode compliance detection based on
      supervised machine learning. The results obtained by these two methods were then 
      compared. RESULTS: For the privacy criterion, the automated system obtained the
      same results as the human expert for 17 of 27 sites (14 true positives and 3 true
      negatives) without noise (0 false positives). The remaining 10 false negative
      instances for the privacy criterion represented tolerable behavior because it is 
      important that all automatically detected principle conformities are accurate
      (ie, specificity [100%] is preferred over sensitivity [58%] for the privacy
      criterion). In addition, the automated system had precision of at least 75%, with
      a recall of more than 50% for contact details (100% precision, 69% recall),
      authority (85% precision, 52% recall), and reference (75% precision, 56% recall).
      The results also revealed issues for some criteria such as date. Changing the
      "document" definition (ie, using the sentence instead of whole document as a unit
      of classification) within the automated system resolved some but not all of them.
      CONCLUSIONS: Study results indicate concordance between automated and expert
      manual compliance detection for authority, privacy, reference, and contact
      details. Results also indicate that using the same general parameters for
      automated detection of each criterion produces suboptimal results. Future work to
      configure optimal system parameters for each HONcode principle would improve
      results. The potential utility of integrating automated detection of HONcode
      conformity into future search engines is also discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Portugal, as in most countries, the most frequent organ donors are
      brain-dead donors. To answer the increasing need for transplants, donation
      programs have been implemented. The goal is to recognize virtually all the
      possible and potential brain-dead donors admitted to hospitals. The aim of this
      work was to describe preliminary results of a software application designed to
      identify devastating neurological injury victims who may progress to brain death 
      and can be possible organ donors. METHODS: This was an observational,
      longitudinal study with retrospective data collection. The software application
      is an automatic algorithm based on natural language processing for selected
      keywords/expressions present in the cranio-encephalic computerized tomography (CE
      CT) scan reports to identify catastrophic neurological situations, with e-mail
      notification to the Transplant Coordinator (TC). The first 7 months of this
      application were analyzed and compared with the standard clinical evaluation
      methodology. RESULTS: The imaging identification tool showed a sensitivity of 77%
      and a specificity of 66%; predictive positive value (PPV) was 0.8 and predictive 
      negative value (PNV) was 0.7 for the identification of catastrophic neurological 
      events. CONCLUSION: The methodology proposed in this work seems promising in
      improving the screening efficiency of critical neurological events.

TI  - Natural Language Processing for Real-Time Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract
      Infection Surveillance: Results of a Pilot Implementation Trial.
PG  - 1004-10
LID - 10.1017/ice.2015.122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is a
      quality benchmark. To streamline conventional detection methods, an electronic
      surveillance system augmented with natural language processing (NLP), which
      gathers data recorded in clinical notes without manual review, was implemented
      for real-time surveillance. OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of this algorithm
      for identifying indwelling urinary catheter days and CAUTI. SETTING: Large, urban
      tertiary care Veterans Affairs hospital. METHODS: All patients admitted to the
      acute care units and the intensive care unit from March 1, 2013, through November
      30, 2013, were included. Standard surveillance, which includes electronic and
      manual data extraction, was compared with the NLP-augmented algorithm. RESULTS:
      The NLP-augmented algorithm identified 27% more indwelling urinary catheter days 
      in the acute care units and 28% fewer indwelling urinary catheter days in the
      intensive care unit. The algorithm flagged 24 CAUTI versus 20 CAUTI by standard
      surveillance methods; the CAUTI identified were overlapping but not the same. The
      overall positive predictive value was 54.2%, and overall sensitivity was 65%
      (90.9% in the acute care units but 33% in the intensive care unit).
      Dissimilarities in the operating characteristics of the algorithm between types
      of unit were due to differences in documentation practice. Development and
      implementation of the algorithm required substantial upfront effort of clinicians
      and programmers to determine current language patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The NLP
      algorithm was most useful for identifying simple clinical variables. Algorithm
      operating characteristics were specific to local documentation practices. The
      algorithm did not perform as well as standard surveillance methods.

TI  - Is there such a thing as landscape genetics?
PG  - 3518-28
LID - 10.1111/mec.13249 [doi]
AB  - For a scientific discipline to be interdisciplinary, it must satisfy two
      conditions; it must consist of contributions from at least two existing
      disciplines, and it must be able to provide insights, through this interaction,
      that neither progenitor discipline could address. In this study, I examine the
      complete body of peer-reviewed literature self-identified as landscape genetics
      (LG) using the statistical approaches of text mining and natural language
      processing. The goal here was to quantify the kinds of questions being addressed 
      in LG studies, the ways in which questions are evaluated mechanistically, and how
      they are differentiated from the progenitor disciplines of landscape ecology and 
      population genetics. I then circumscribe the main factions within published LG
      studies examining the extent to which emergent questions are being addressed and 
      highlighting a deep bifurcation between existing individual- and population-based
      approaches. I close by providing some suggestions on where theoretical and
      analytical work is needed if LGs is to serve as a real bridge connecting
      evolution and ecology sensu lato.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sphenoid wing meningiomas extending to the orbit (ePMSW) are
      currently removed through several transcranial approaches. Presenting the largest
      surgical cohort of hyperostosing ePMSW with the longest follow up period, we will
      provide data supporting minilateral orbitotomy with excellent exposure for wide
      resection of all compartments of the tumor. METHODS: A retrospective survival
      analysis is made of the data cumulated prospectively during a period of 34 years,
      including 88 cases of ePMSW with a mean follow up period of 136.4 months. The
      impact of preoperative variables upon different outcome measures is evaluated.
      Standard pterional craniotomy was performed in 12 patients (C) while the other 76
      cases underwent the proposed modified lateral miniorbitotomy (LO). RESULTS: There
      were 31 men and 57 women. The age range varied between 12 and 70 years. Patients 
      presented with unilateral exophthalmos (Uex) ranging between 3 and 16 mm.
      Duration of proptosis before operation varied between 6 months and 16 years. The 
      status of visual acuity (VA) prior to operation was: no light perception (NLP) in
      16, light perception (LP) up to 0.2 in 3, 0.3-0.5 in 22, 0.6-0.9 in 24, and full 
      vision in 23 patients. Postoperatively, acceptable cosmetic appearance of the
      eyes was seen in 38 cases and in 46 mild inequality of < 2 mm was detected. Four 
      cases had mild enophthalmos (En). Among those who had the worst VA, two improved 
      and one became almost blind after operation. The cases with VA in the range of
      0.3-0.5 improved. Among those with good VA (0.5 to full vision), 2 became blind, 
      vision diminished in 10, and improved or remained full in the other 35 cases.
      Tumor recurrence occurred in 33.3% of group C and 10.5% of group LO (P = 0.05).
      The major determinant of tumor regrowth was the technique of LO (P = 0.008).
      CONCLUSION: Using LO technique, the risky corners involved by the tumor is
      visualized from the latero-inferior side rather than from the latero-superior
      avenue. This is the crucial milestone to achieve aggressive removal of all the
      involved compartments of the lesion. Satisfactory cosmetic result is reported
      using mini LO technique after widely exposing and removing the hyperostotic bone 
      down to the subtemporal fossa with only simple repair of the dura without
      cranioplasty.

AB  - The 2014 i2b2/UTHealth natural language processing shared task featured a track
      focused on identifying risk factors for heart disease (specifically, Cardiac
      Artery Disease) in clinical narratives. For this track, we used a "light"
      annotation paradigm to annotate a set of 1304 longitudinal medical records
      describing 296 patients for risk factors and the times they were present. We
      designed the annotation task for this track with the goal of balancing annotation
      load and time with quality, so as to generate a gold standard corpus that can
      benefit a clinically-relevant task. We applied light annotation procedures and
      determined the gold standard using majority voting. On average, the agreement of 
      annotators with the gold standard was above 0.95, indicating high reliability.
      The resulting document-level annotations generated for each record in each
      longitudinal EMR in this corpus provide information that can support studies of
      progression of heart disease risk factors in the included patients over time.
      These annotations were used in the Risk Factor track of the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth
      shared task. Participating systems achieved a mean micro-averaged F1 measure of
      0.815 and a maximum F1 measure of 0.928 for identifying these risk factors in
      patient records.

AB  - Telemedicine is the medical practice of information exchanged from one location
      to another through electronic communications to improve the delivery of health
      care services. This research article describes a telemedicine framework with
      knowledge engineering using taxonomic reasoning of ontology modeling and semantic
      similarity. In addition to being a precious support in the procedure of medical
      decision-making, this framework can be used to strengthen significant
      collaborations and traceability that are important for the development of
      official deployment of telemedicine applications. Adequate mechanisms for
      information management with traceability of the reasoning process are also
      essential in the fields of epidemiology and public health. In this paper we
      enrich the case-based reasoning process by taking into account former
      evidence-based knowledge. We use the regular four steps approach and implement an
      additional (iii) step: (i) establish diagnosis, (ii) retrieve treatment, (iii)
      apply evidence, (iv) adaptation, (v) retain. Each step is performed using tools
      from knowledge engineering and information processing (natural language
      processing, ontology, indexation, algorithm, etc.). The case representation is
      done by the taxonomy component of a medical ontology model. The proposed approach
      is illustrated with an example from the oncology domain. Medical ontology allows 
      a good and efficient modeling of the patient and his treatment. We are pointing
      up the role of evidences and specialist's opinions in effectiveness and safety of
      care.

TI  - Mood instability is a common feature of mental health disorders and is associated
      with poor clinical outcomes.
PG  - e007504
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-007504 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mood instability is a clinically important phenomenon but has
      received relatively little research attention. The objective of this study was to
      assess the impact of mood instability on clinical outcomes in a large sample of
      people receiving secondary mental healthcare. DESIGN: Observational study using
      an anonymised electronic health record case register. SETTING: South London and
      Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM), a large provider of inpatient and community mental
      healthcare in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 27,704 adults presenting to SLaM between
      April 2006 and March 2013 with a psychotic, affective or personality disorder.
      EXPOSURE: The presence of mood instability within 1 month of presentation,
      identified using natural language processing (NLP). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
      number of days spent in hospital, frequency of hospital admission, compulsory
      hospital admission and prescription of antipsychotics or non-antipsychotic mood
      stabilisers over a 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Mood instability was
      documented in 12.1% of people presenting to mental healthcare services. It was
      most frequently documented in people with bipolar disorder (22.6%), but was
      common in people with personality disorder (17.8%) and schizophrenia (15.5%). It 
      was associated with a greater number of days spent in hospital (beta coefficient 
      18.5, 95% CI 12.1 to 24.8), greater frequency of hospitalisation (incidence rate 
      ratio 1.95, 1.75 to 2.17), greater likelihood of compulsory admission (OR 2.73,
      2.34 to 3.19) and an increased likelihood of prescription of antipsychotics
      (2.03, 1.75 to 2.35) or non-antipsychotic mood stabilisers (2.07, 1.77 to 2.41). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mood instability occurs in a wide range of mental disorders and is
      not limited to affective disorders. It is generally associated with relatively
      poor clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that clinicians should screen for 
      mood instability across all common mental health disorders. The data also suggest
      that targeted interventions for mood instability may be useful in patients who do
      not have a formal affective disorder.

TI  - Sequential pattern mining for discovering gene interactions and their contextual 
      information from biomedical texts.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/s13326-015-0023-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Discovering gene interactions and their characterizations from
      biological text collections is a crucial issue in bioinformatics. Indeed, text
      collections are large and it is very difficult for biologists to fully take
      benefit from this amount of knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods 
      have been applied to extract background knowledge from biomedical texts. Some of 
      existing NLP approaches are based on handcrafted rules and thus are time
      consuming and often devoted to a specific corpus. Machine learning based NLP
      methods, give good results but generate outcomes that are not really
      understandable by a user. RESULTS: We take advantage of an hybridization of data 
      mining and natural language processing to propose an original symbolic method to 
      automatically produce patterns conveying gene interactions and their
      characterizations. Therefore, our method not only allows gene interactions but
      also semantics information on the extracted interactions (e.g., modalities,
      biological contexts, interaction types) to be detected. Only limited resource is 
      required: the text collection that is used as a training corpus. Our approach
      gives results comparable to the results given by state-of-the-art methods and is 
      even better for the gene interaction detection in AIMed. CONCLUSIONS: Experiments
      show how our approach enables to discover interactions and their
      characterizations. To the best of our knowledge, there is few methods that
      automatically extract the interactions and also associated semantics information.
      The extracted gene interactions from PubMed are available through a simple web
      interface at https://bingotexte.greyc.fr/. The software is available at
      https://bingo2.greyc.fr/?q=node/22.

TI  - Networks of neuroinjury semantic predications to identify biomarkers for mild
      traumatic brain injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has high prevalence in the
      military, among athletes, and in the general population worldwide (largely due to
      falls). Consequences can include a range of neuropsychological disorders.
      Unfortunately, such neural injury often goes undiagnosed due to the difficulty in
      identifying symptoms, so the discovery of an effective biomarker would greatly
      assist diagnosis; however, no single biomarker has been identified. We identify
      several body substances as potential components of a panel of biomarkers to
      support the diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury. METHODS: Our approach to
      diagnostic biomarker discovery combines ideas and techniques from systems
      medicine, natural language processing, and graph theory. We create a molecular
      interaction network that represents neural injury and is composed of
      relationships automatically extracted from the literature. We retrieve citations 
      related to neurological injury and extract relationships (semantic predications) 
      that contain potential biomarkers. After linking all relationships together to
      create a network representing neural injury, we filter the network by
      relationship frequency and concept connectivity to reduce the set to a manageable
      size of higher interest substances. RESULTS: 99,437 relevant citations yielded
      26,441 unique relations. 18,085 of these contained a potential biomarker as
      subject or object with a total of 6246 unique concepts. After filtering by graph 
      metrics, the set was reduced to 1021 relationships with 49 unique concepts,
      including 17 potential biomarkers. CONCLUSION: We created a network of
      relationships containing substances derived from 99,437 citations and filtered
      using graph metrics to provide a set of 17 potential biomarkers. We discuss the
      interaction of several of these (glutamate, glucose, and lactate) as the basis
      for more effective diagnosis than is currently possible. This method provides an 
      opportunity to focus the effort of wet bench research on those substances with
      the highest potential as biomarkers for mTBI.

TI  - Sharing models and tools for processing German clinical texts.
PG  - 734-8
AB  - The automatic processing of non-English clinical documents is massively hampered 
      by the lack of publicly available medical language resources for training,
      testing and evaluating NLP components. We suggest sharing statistical models
      derived from access-protected clinical documents as a reasonable substitute and
      provide solutions for sentence splitting, tokenization and POS tagging of German 
      clinical texts. These three components were trained on the confidential FRAMED
      corpus, a non-sharable collection of various German-language clinical document
      types. The models derived therefrom outperform alternative components from
      OPENNLP and the Stanford POS tagger, also trained on FRAMED.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine practice requires practitioners to obtain the
      best available medical evidence, and appraise the quality of the evidence when
      making clinical decisions. Primarily due to the plethora of electronically
      available data from the medical literature, the manual appraisal of the quality
      of evidence is a time-consuming process. We present a fully automatic approach
      for predicting the quality of medical evidence in order to aid practitioners at
      point-of-care. METHODS: Our approach extracts relevant information from medical
      article abstracts and utilises data from a specialised corpus to apply supervised
      machine learning for the prediction of the quality grades. Following an in-depth 
      analysis of the usefulness of features (e.g., publication types of articles),
      they are extracted from the text via rule-based approaches and from the meta-data
      associated with the articles, and then applied in the supervised classification
      model. We propose the use of a highly scalable and portable approach using a
      sequence of high precision classifiers, and introduce a simple evaluation metric 
      called average error distance (AED) that simplifies the comparison of systems. We
      also perform elaborate human evaluations to compare the performance of our system
      against human judgments. RESULTS: We test and evaluate our approaches on a
      publicly available, specialised, annotated corpus containing 1132 evidence-based 
      recommendations. Our rule-based approach performs exceptionally well at the
      automatic extraction of publication types of articles, with F-scores of up to
      0.99 for high-quality publication types. For evidence quality classification, our
      approach obtains an accuracy of 63.84% and an AED of 0.271. The human evaluations
      show that the performance of our system, in terms of AED and accuracy, is
      comparable to the performance of humans on the same data. CONCLUSIONS: The
      experiments suggest that our structured text classification framework achieves
      evaluation results comparable to those of human performance. Our overall
      classification approach and evaluation technique are also highly portable and can
      be used for various evidence grading scales.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the non-lactating period
      (NLP) length on the subsequent calving ease and reproductive performance of the
      purebred Holstein (HO), Brown Swiss (BS) and F1 crosses (BF) of these breeds. The
      NLP length was classified into four categories: D1: <45d; D2: 45-60d; D3: 60-75d;
      and D4: >75d. The lesser incidence of calving difficulty in the purebred HO and
      BF crossbred cows was recorded at D3, with no significant differences with D2
      [11.6% and 9.5%; Crude Odds Ratio (COR)=1.10 and 0.84, respectively]. However,
      the minimum incidence of calving difficulty in the purebred BS cows was at the
      same NLP length with significant differences with D2 (3.8%; COR=0.31). All
      reproductive indices of the purebred HO cows were less as the NLP length
      increased. However, lesser estimates of calving interval and days non-pregnant in
      purebred BS and BF crossbred cows were recorded at longer (D3) NLP (350 and 328d;
      112 and 133d, respectively). Purebred HO cows had decreased milk production at
      extremely short (D1) and long (D4) NLP. Purebred BS cows, however, were more
      persistent in milk production and had more consistent body condition scores
      (BCS). In conclusion, shortening the NLP of the purebred HO cows in addition to
      making minimum changes in diet composition could be an appropriate solution for
      improving reproduction. Purebred BS and BF crossbred cows were more persistent in
      milk production and tolerated the diet changes during the NLP.

TI  - Automating the generation of lexical patterns for processing free text in
      clinical documents.
PG  - 980-6
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many tasks in natural language processing utilize lexical
      pattern-matching techniques, including information extraction (IE), negation
      identification, and syntactic parsing. However, it is generally difficult to
      derive patterns that achieve acceptable levels of recall while also remaining
      highly precise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a multiple sequence alignment
      (MSA)-based technique that automatically generates patterns, thereby leveraging
      language usage to determine the context of words that influence a given target.
      MSAs capture the commonalities among word sequences and are able to reveal areas 
      of linguistic stability and variation. In this way, MSAs provide a systemic
      approach to generating lexical patterns that are generalizable, which will both
      increase recall levels and maintain high levels of precision. RESULTS: The
      MSA-generated patterns exhibited consistent F1-, F.5-, and F2- scores compared to
      two baseline techniques for IE across four different tasks. Both baseline
      techniques performed well for some tasks and less well for others, but MSA was
      found to consistently perform at a high level for all four tasks. DISCUSSION: The
      performance of MSA on the four extraction tasks indicates the method's
      versatility. The results show that the MSA-based patterns are able to handle the 
      extraction of individual data elements as well as relations between two concepts 
      without the need for large amounts of manual intervention. CONCLUSION: We
      presented an MSA-based framework for generating lexical patterns that showed
      consistently high levels of both performance and recall over four different
      extraction tasks when compared to baseline methods.

      anatomy into computable anatomy.
PG  - bav040

LID - bav040 [pii]
AB  - The diverse phenotypes of living organisms have been described for centuries, and
      though they may be digitized, they are not readily available in a computable
      form. Using over 100 morphological studies, the Phenoscape project has
      demonstrated that by annotating characters with community ontology terms, links
      between novel species anatomy and the genes that may underlie them can be made.
      But given the enormity of the legacy literature, how can this largely unexploited
      wealth of descriptive data be rendered amenable to large-scale computation? To
      identify the bottlenecks, we quantified the time involved in the major aspects of
      phenotype curation as we annotated characters from the vertebrate phylogenetic
      systematics literature. This involves attaching fully computable logical
      expressions consisting of ontology terms to the descriptions in
      character-by-taxon matrices. The workflow consists of: (i) data preparation, (ii)
      phenotype annotation, (iii) ontology development and (iv) curation team
      discussions and software development feedback. Our results showed that the
      completion of this work required two person-years by a team of two post-docs, a
      lead data curator, and students. Manual data preparation required close to 13% of
      the effort. This part in particular could be reduced substantially with better
      community data practices, such as depositing fully populated matrices in public
      repositories. Phenotype annotation required approximately 40% of the effort. We
      are working to make this more efficient with Natural Language Processing tools.
      Ontology development (40%), however, remains a highly manual task requiring
      domain (anatomical) expertise and use of specialized software. The large overhead
      required for data preparation and ontology development contributed to a low
      annotation rate of approximately two characters per hour, compared with 14
      characters per hour when activity was restricted to character annotation.
      Unlocking the potential of the vast stores of morphological descriptions requires
      better tools for efficiently processing natural language, and better community
      practices towards a born-digital morphology. Database URL:

TI  - Exploring relation types for literature-based discovery.
PG  - 987-92
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Literature-based discovery (LBD) aims to identify "hidden knowledge"
      in the medical literature by: (1) analyzing documents to identify pairs of
      explicitly related concepts (terms), then (2) hypothesizing novel relations
      between pairs of unrelated concepts that are implicitly related via a shared
      concept to which both are explicitly related. Many LBD approaches use simple
      techniques to identify semantically weak relations between concepts, for example,
      document co-occurrence. These generate huge numbers of hypotheses, difficult for 
      humans to assess. More complex techniques rely on linguistic analysis, for
      example, shallow parsing, to identify semantically stronger relations. Such
      approaches generate fewer hypotheses, but may miss hidden knowledge. The authors 
      investigate this trade-off in detail, comparing techniques for identifying
      related concepts to discover which are most suitable for LBD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A generic LBD system that can utilize a range of relation types was
      developed. Experiments were carried out comparing a number of techniques for
      identifying relations. Two approaches were used for evaluation: replication of
      existing discoveries and the "time slicing" approach.(1) RESULTS: Previous LBD
      discoveries could be replicated using relations based either on document
      co-occurrence or linguistic analysis. Using relations based on linguistic
      analysis generated many fewer hypotheses, but a significantly greater proportion 
      of them were candidates for hidden knowledge. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The use 
      of linguistic analysis-based relations improves accuracy of LBD without overly
      damaging coverage. LBD systems often generate huge numbers of hypotheses, which
      are infeasible to manually review. Improving their accuracy has the potential to 
      make these systems significantly more usable.

TI  - Resource construction and evaluation for indirect opinion mining of drug reviews.
PG  - e0124993
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0124993 [doi]
AB  - Opinion mining is a well-known problem in natural language processing that has
      attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing approaches are mainly
      limited to the identification of direct opinions and are mostly dedicated to
      explicit opinions. However, in some domains such as medical, the opinions about
      an entity are not usually expressed by opinion words directly, but they are
      expressed indirectly by describing the effect of that entity on other ones.
      Therefore, ignoring indirect opinions can lead to the loss of valuable
      information and noticeable decline in overall accuracy of opinion mining systems.
      In this paper, we first introduce the task of indirect opinion mining. Then, we
      present a novel approach to construct a knowledge base of indirect opinions,
      called OpinionKB, which aims to be a resource for automatically classifying
      people's opinions about drugs. Using our approach, we have extracted 896
      quadruples of indirect opinions at a precision of 88.08 percent. Furthermore,
      experiments on drug reviews demonstrate that our approach can achieve 85.25
      percent precision in polarity detection task, and outperforms the
      state-of-the-art opinion mining methods. We also build a corpus of indirect
      opinions about drugs, which can be used as a basis for supervised indirect
      opinion mining. The proposed approach for corpus construction achieves the
      precision of 88.42 percent.

TI  - Healthcare costs and resource utilization of patients with binge-eating disorder 
      and eating disorder not otherwise specified in the Department of Veterans
      Affairs.
PG  - 1082-91
LID - 10.1002/eat.22427 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the one-year healthcare
      costs and utilization of patients with binge-eating disorder (BED) to patients
      with eating disorder not otherwise specified without BED (EDNOS-only) and to
      matched patients without an eating disorder (NED). METHODS: A natural language
      processing (NLP) algorithm identified adults with BED from clinical notes in the 
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health record database from 2000
      to 2011. Patients with EDNOS-only were identified using ICD-9 code (307.50) and
      those with NLP-identified BED were excluded. First diagnosis date defined the
      index date for both groups. Patients with NED were randomly matched 4:1, as
      available, to patients with BED on age, sex, BMI, depression diagnosis, and index
      month. Patients with cost data (2005-2011) were included. Total healthcare,
      inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy costs were examined. Generalized linear
      models were used to compare total one-year healthcare costs while adjusting for
      baseline patient characteristics. RESULTS: There were 257 BED, 743 EDNOS-only,
      and 823 matched NED patients identified. The mean (SD) total unadjusted one-year 
      costs, in 2011 US dollars, were $33,716 ($38,928) for BED, $37,052 ($40,719) for 
      EDNOS-only, and $19,548 ($35,780) for NED patients. When adjusting for patient
      characteristics, BED patients had one-year total healthcare costs $5,589 higher
      than EDNOS-only (p = 0.06) and $18,152 higher than matched NED patients (p <
      0.001). DISCUSSION: This study is the first to use NLP to identify BED patients
      and quantify their healthcare costs and utilization. Patients with BED had
      similar one-year total healthcare costs to EDNOS-only patients, but significantly
      higher costs than patients with NED.

TI  - Web-based textual analysis of free-text patient experience comments from a survey
      in primary care.
PG  - e20
LID - 10.2196/medinform.3783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Open-ended questions eliciting free-text comments have been widely
      adopted in surveys of patient experience. Analysis of free text comments can
      provide deeper or new insight, identify areas for action, and initiate further
      investigation. Also, they may be a promising way to progress from documentation
      of patient experience to achieving quality improvement. The usual methods of
      analyzing free-text comments are known to be time and resource intensive. To
      efficiently deal with a large amount of free-text, new methods of rapidly
      summarizing and characterizing the text are being explored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of
      this study was to investigate the feasibility of using freely available Web-based
      text processing tools (text clouds, distinctive word extraction, key words in
      context) for extracting useful information from large amounts of free-text
      commentary about patient experience, as an alternative to more resource intensive
      analytic methods. METHODS: We collected free-text responses to a broad,
      open-ended question on patients' experience of primary care in a cross-sectional 
      postal survey of patients recently consulting doctors in 25 English general
      practices. We encoded the responses to text files which were then uploaded to
      three Web-based textual processing tools. The tools we used were two text cloud
      creators: TagCrowd for unigrams, and Many Eyes for bigrams; and Voyant Tools, a
      Web-based reading tool that can extract distinctive words and perform Keyword in 
      Context (KWIC) analysis. The association of patients' experience scores with the 
      occurrence of certain words was tested with logistic regression analysis. KWIC
      analysis was also performed to gain insight into the use of a significant word.
      RESULTS: In total, 3426 free-text responses were received from 7721 patients
      (comment rate: 44.4%). The five most frequent words in the patients' comments
      were "doctor", "appointment", "surgery", "practice", and "time". The three most
      frequent two-word combinations were "reception staff", "excellent service", and
      "two weeks". The regression analysis showed that the occurrence of the word
      "excellent" in the comments was significantly associated with a better patient
      experience (OR=1.96, 95%CI=1.63-2.34), while "rude" was significantly associated 
      with a worse experience (OR=0.53, 95%CI=0.46-0.60). The KWIC results revealed
      that 49 of the 78 (63%) occurrences of the word "rude" in the comments were
      related to receptionists and 17(22%) were related to doctors. CONCLUSIONS:
      Web-based text processing tools can extract useful information from free-text
      comments and the output may serve as a springboard for further investigation.
      Text clouds, distinctive words extraction and KWIC analysis show promise in quick
      evaluation of unstructured patient feedback. The results are easily
      understandable, but may require further probing such as KWIC analysis to
      establish the context. Future research should explore whether more sophisticated 
      methods of textual analysis (eg, sentiment analysis, natural language processing)
      could add additional levels of understanding.

TI  - An end-to-end hybrid algorithm for automated medication discrepancy detection.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s12911-015-0160-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study we implemented and developed state-of-the-art machine
      learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies and built a
      computerized algorithm for medication reconciliation. Our specific aims are: (1) 
      to develop a computerized algorithm for medication discrepancy detection between 
      patients' discharge prescriptions (structured data) and medications documented in
      free-text clinical notes (unstructured data); and (2) to assess the performance
      of the algorithm on real-world medication reconciliation data. METHODS: We
      collected clinical notes and discharge prescription lists for all 271 patients
      enrolled in the Complex Care Medical Home Program at Cincinnati Children's
      Hospital Medical Center between 1/1/2010 and 12/31/2013. A double-annotated,
      gold-standard set of medication reconciliation data was created for this
      collection. We then developed a hybrid algorithm consisting of three processes:
      (1) a ML algorithm to identify medication entities from clinical notes, (2) a
      rule-based method to link medication names with their attributes, and (3) a
      NLP-based, hybrid approach to match medications with structured prescriptions in 
      order to detect medication discrepancies. The performance was validated on the
      gold-standard medication reconciliation data, where precision (P), recall (R),
      F-value (F) and workload were assessed. RESULTS: The hybrid algorithm achieved
      95.0%/91.6%/93.3% of P/R/F on medication entity detection and 98.7%/99.4%/99.1%
      of P/R/F on attribute linkage. The medication matching achieved 92.4%/90.7%/91.5%
      (P/R/F) on identifying matched medications in the gold-standard and
      88.6%/82.5%/85.5% (P/R/F) on discrepant medications. By combining all processes, 
      the algorithm achieved 92.4%/90.7%/91.5% (P/R/F) and 71.5%/65.2%/68.2% (P/R/F) on
      identifying the matched and the discrepant medications, respectively. The error
      analysis on algorithm outputs identified challenges to be addressed in order to
      improve medication discrepancy detection. CONCLUSION: By leveraging ML and NLP
      technologies, an end-to-end, computerized algorithm achieves promising outcome in
      reconciling medications between clinical notes and discharge prescriptions.

TI  - Balloons and bavoons versus spikes and shikes: ERPs reveal shared neural
      processes for shape-sound-meaning congruence in words, and shape-sound congruence
      in pseudowords.

AB  - There is something about the sound of a pseudoword like takete that goes better
      with a spiky, than a curvy shape (Kohler, 1929:1947). Yet despite decades of
      research into sound symbolism, the role of this effect on real words in the
      lexicons of natural languages remains controversial. We report one behavioural
      and one ERP study investigating whether sound symbolism is active during normal
      language processing for real words in a speaker's native language, in the same
      way as for novel word forms. The results indicate that sound-symbolic congruence 
      has a number of influences on natural language processing: Written forms
      presented in a congruent visual context generate more errors during lexical
      access, as well as a chain of differences in the ERP. These effects have a very
      early onset (40-80 ms, 100-160 ms, 280-320 ms) and are later overshadowed by
      familiar types of semantic processing, indicating that sound symbolism represents
      an early sensory-co-activation effect.

AB  - One effective way to improve the state of the art is through competitions.
      Following the success of the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction 
      (CASP) in bioinformatics research, a number of challenge evaluations have been
      organized by the text-mining research community to assess and advance natural
      language processing (NLP) research for biomedicine. In this article, we review
      the different community challenge evaluations held from 2002 to 2014 and their
      respective tasks. Furthermore, we examine these challenge tasks through their
      targeted problems in NLP research and biomedical applications, respectively.
      Next, we describe the general workflow of organizing a Biomedical NLP (BioNLP)
      challenge and involved stakeholders (task organizers, task data producers, task
      participants and end users). Finally, we summarize the impact and contributions
      by taking into account different BioNLP challenges as a whole, followed by a
      discussion of their limitations and difficulties. We conclude with future trends 
      in BioNLP challenge evaluations.

TI  - Toward high-throughput phenotyping: unbiased automated feature extraction and
      selection from knowledge sources.
PG  - 993-1000
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv034 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Analysis of narrative (text) data from electronic health records
      (EHRs) can improve population-scale phenotyping for clinical and genetic
      research. Currently, selection of text features for phenotyping algorithms is
      slow and laborious, requiring extensive and iterative involvement by domain
      experts. This paper introduces a method to develop phenotyping algorithms in an
      unbiased manner by automatically extracting and selecting informative features,
      which can be comparable to expert-curated ones in classification accuracy.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comprehensive medical concepts were collected from
      publicly available knowledge sources in an automated, unbiased fashion. Natural
      language processing (NLP) revealed the occurrence patterns of these concepts in
      EHR narrative notes, which enabled selection of informative features for
      phenotype classification. When combined with additional codified features, a
      penalized logistic regression model was trained to classify the target phenotype.
      RESULTS: The authors applied our method to develop algorithms to identify
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis and coronary artery disease cases among those 
      with rheumatoid arthritis from a large multi-institutional EHR. The area under
      the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for classifying RA and CAD
      using models trained with automated features were 0.951 and 0.929, respectively, 
      compared to the AUCs of 0.938 and 0.929 by models trained with expert-curated
      features. DISCUSSION: Models trained with NLP text features selected through an
      unbiased, automated procedure achieved comparable or slightly higher accuracy
      than those trained with expert-curated features. The majority of the selected
      model features were interpretable. CONCLUSION: The proposed automated feature
      extraction method, generating highly accurate phenotyping algorithms with
      improved efficiency, is a significant step toward high-throughput phenotyping.

TI  - Automated Extraction of VTE Events From Narrative Radiology Reports in Electronic
      Health Records: A Validation Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) is necessary for
      improving patient safety in acute care hospitals, but current detection methods
      are inaccurate and inefficient. With the growing availability of clinical
      narratives in an electronic format, automated surveillance using natural language
      processing (NLP) techniques may represent a better method. OBJECTIVE: We assessed
      the accuracy of using symbolic NLP for identifying the 2 clinical manifestations 
      of VTE, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), from narrative
      radiology reports. METHODS: A random sample of 4000 narrative reports was
      selected among imaging studies that could diagnose DVT or PE, and that were
      performed between 2008 and 2012 in a university health network of 5 adult-care
      hospitals in Montreal (Canada). The reports were coded by clinical experts to
      identify positive and negative cases of DVT and PE, which served as the reference
      standard. Using data from the largest hospital (n=2788), 2 symbolic NLP
      classifiers were trained; one for DVT, the other for PE. The accuracy of these
      classifiers was tested on data from the other 4 hospitals (n=1212). RESULTS: On
      manual review, 663 DVT-positive and 272 PE-positive reports were identified. In
      the testing dataset, the DVT classifier achieved 94% sensitivity (95% CI,
      88%-97%), 96% specificity (95% CI, 94%-97%), and 73% positive predictive value
      (95% CI, 65%-80%), whereas the PE classifier achieved 94% sensitivity (95% CI,
      89%-97%), 96% specificity (95% CI, 95%-97%), and 80% positive predictive value
      (95% CI, 73%-85%). CONCLUSIONS: Symbolic NLP can accurately identify VTEs from
      narrative radiology reports. This method could facilitate VTE surveillance and
      the evaluation of preventive measures.This is an open-access article distributed

TI  - Benchmarking clinical speech recognition and information extraction: new data,
      methods, and evaluations.
PG  - e19
LID - 10.2196/medinform.4321 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over a tenth of preventable adverse events in health care are caused 
      by failures in information flow. These failures are tangible in clinical
      handover; regardless of good verbal handover, from two-thirds to all of this
      information is lost after 3-5 shifts if notes are taken by hand, or not at all.
      Speech recognition and information extraction provide a way to fill out a
      handover form for clinical proofing and sign-off. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the
      study was to provide a recorded spoken handover, annotated verbatim
      transcriptions, and evaluations to support research in spoken and written natural
      language processing for filling out a clinical handover form. This dataset is
      based on synthetic patient profiles, thereby avoiding ethical and legal
      restrictions, while maintaining efficacy for research in speech-to-text
      conversion and information extraction, based on realistic clinical scenarios. We 
      also introduce a Web app to demonstrate the system design and workflow. METHODS: 
      We experiment with Dragon Medical 11.0 for speech recognition and CRF++ for
      information extraction. To compute features for information extraction, we also
      apply CoreNLP, MetaMap, and Ontoserver. Our evaluation uses cross-validation
      techniques to measure processing correctness. RESULTS: The data provided were a
      simulation of nursing handover, as recorded using a mobile device, built from
      simulated patient records and handover scripts, spoken by an Australian
      registered nurse. Speech recognition recognized 5276 of 7277 words in our 100
      test documents correctly. We considered 50 mutually exclusive categories in
      information extraction and achieved the F1 (ie, the harmonic mean of Precision
      and Recall) of 0.86 in the category for irrelevant text and the macro-averaged F1
      of 0.70 over the remaining 35 nonempty categories of the form in our 101 test
      documents. CONCLUSIONS: The significance of this study hinges on opening our
      data, together with the related performance benchmarks and some processing
      software, to the research and development community for studying clinical
      documentation and language-processing. The data are used in the CLEFeHealth 2015 
      evaluation laboratory for a shared task on speech recognition.

AB  - Accurate electronic health records are important for clinical care and research
      as well as ensuring patient safety. It is crucial for misspelled words to be
      corrected in order to ensure that medical records are interpreted correctly. This
      paper describes the development of a spelling correction system for medical text.
      Our spell checker is based on Shannon's noisy channel model, and uses an
      extensive dictionary compiled from many sources. We also use named entity
      recognition, so that names are not wrongly corrected as misspellings. We apply
      our spell checker to three different types of free-text data: clinical notes,
      allergy entries, and medication orders; and evaluate its performance on both
      misspelling detection and correction. Our spell checker achieves detection
      performance of up to 94.4% and correction accuracy of up to 88.2%. We show that

AB  - Although potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) are a significant source of
      preventable drug-related harm, there is currently no single complete source of
      PDDI information. In the current study, all publically available sources of PDDI 
      information that could be identified using a comprehensive and broad search were 
      combined into a single dataset. The combined dataset merged fourteen different
      sources including 5 clinically-oriented information sources, 4 Natural Language
      Processing (NLP) Corpora, and 5 Bioinformatics/Pharmacovigilance information
      sources. As a comprehensive PDDI source, the merged dataset might benefit the
      pharmacovigilance text mining community by making it possible to compare the
      representativeness of NLP corpora for PDDI text extraction tasks, and specifying 
      elements that can be useful for future PDDI extraction purposes. An analysis of
      the overlap between and across the data sources showed that there was little
      overlap. Even comprehensive PDDI lists such as DrugBank, KEGG, and the NDF-RT had
      less than 50% overlap with each other. Moreover, all of the comprehensive lists
      had incomplete coverage of two data sources that focus on PDDIs of interest in
      most clinical settings. Based on this information, we think that systems that
      provide access to the comprehensive lists, such as APIs into RxNorm, should be
      careful to inform users that the lists may be incomplete with respect to PDDIs
      that drug experts suggest clinicians be aware of. In spite of the low degree of
      overlap, several dozen cases were identified where PDDI information provided in
      drug product labeling might be augmented by the merged dataset. Moreover, the
      combined dataset was also shown to improve the performance of an existing PDDI
      NLP pipeline and a recently published PDDI pharmacovigilance protocol. Future
      work will focus on improvement of the methods for mapping between PDDI
      information sources, identifying methods to improve the use of the merged dataset
      in PDDI NLP algorithms, integrating high-quality PDDI information from the merged
      dataset into Wikidata, and making the combined dataset accessible as Semantic Web
      Linked Data.

TI  - Natural language processing as an alternative to manual reporting of colonoscopy 
      quality metrics.
PG  - 512-9
LID - 10.1016/j.gie.2015.01.049 [doi]
LID - S0016-5107(15)00100-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a quality metric tied to
      interval colon cancer occurrence. However, manual extraction of data to calculate
      and track the ADR in clinical practice is labor-intensive. To overcome this
      difficulty, we developed a natural language processing (NLP) method to identify
      adenomas and sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) in patients undergoing their first 
      screening colonoscopy. We compared the NLP-generated results with that of manual 
      data extraction to test the accuracy of NLP and report on colonoscopy quality
      metrics using NLP. METHODS: Identification of screening colonoscopies using NLP
      was compared with that using the manual method for 12,748 patients who underwent 
      colonoscopies from July 2010 to February 2013. Also, identification of adenomas
      and SSAs using NLP was compared with that using the manual method with 2259
      matched patient records. Colonoscopy ADRs using these methods were generated for 
      each physician. RESULTS: NLP correctly identified 91.3% of the screening
      examinations, whereas the manual method identified 87.8% of them. Both the manual
      method and NLP correctly identified examinations of patients with adenomas and
      SSAs in the matched records almost perfectly. Both NLP and the manual method
      produced comparable values for ADRs for each endoscopist and for the group as a
      whole. CONCLUSIONS: NLP can correctly identify screening colonoscopies,
      accurately identify adenomas and SSAs in a pathology database, and provide
      real-time quality metrics for colonoscopy.

TI  - Structured learning for spatial information extraction from biomedical text:
      bacteria biotopes.
PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/s12859-015-0542-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aim to automatically extract species names of bacteria and their
      locations from webpages. This task is important for exploiting the vast amount of
      biological knowledge which is expressed in diverse natural language texts and
      putting this knowledge in databases for easy access by biologists. The task is
      challenging and the previous results are far below an acceptable level of
      performance, particularly for extraction of localization relationships.
      Therefore, we aim to design a new system for such extractions, using the
      framework of structured machine learning techniques. RESULTS: We design a new
      model for joint extraction of biomedical entities and the localization
      relationship. Our model is based on a spatial role labeling (SpRL) model designed
      for spatial understanding of unrestricted text. We extend SpRL to extract
      discourse level spatial relations in the biomedical domain and apply it on the
      BioNLP-ST 2013, BB-shared task. We highlight the main differences between general
      spatial language understanding and spatial information extraction from the
      scientific text which is the focus of this work. We exploit the text's structure 
      and discourse level global features. Our model and the designed features
      substantially improve on the previous systems, achieving an absolute improvement 
      of approximately 57 percent over F1 measure of the best previous system for this 
      task. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental results indicate that a joint learning model 
      over all entities and relationships in a document outperforms a model which
      extracts entities and relationships independently. Our global learning model
      significantly improves the state-of-the-art results on this task and has a high
      potential to be adopted in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks in the
      biomedical domain.

AB  - Nesfatin-1 (82 amino acid) is an anorexigenic and insulinotropic peptide encoded 
      in a secreted precursor, nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2). Nucleobindin-1 (NUCB1) is a
      protein with very high sequence similarity to NUCB2. We hypothesized that a
      nesfatin-1 like peptide (NLP) is encoded in NUCB1, and this peptide is
      biologically active. In silico analysis found a signal peptide cleavage site at
      position 25 (Arginine) and 26 (Valine) preceding the NLP region in NUCB1
      sequence, and potential proprotein convertase cleavage sites at Lys-Arg (KR),
      forming a 77 amino acid NLP. RT-PCR studies found NUCB1 mRNA in both pancreas and
      MIN6 cells. NUCB1-like immunoreactivity was detected in mouse insulinoma (MIN6)
      cells, and pancreatic islet beta cells of mice. In order to determine the
      biological activity of NLP, MIN6 cells were incubated with synthetic rat NLP. NLP
      (10nM and 100nM) upregulated preproinsulin mRNA expression and insulin secretion 
      at 1h post-incubation. In identical experiments using MIN6 cells, a scrambled
      peptide based on the NLP sequence did not elicit any effects on preproinsulin
      mRNA expression or insulin secretion. From this result, it is clear that an
      intact NLP sequence is required for its biological activity. NLP appears as
      another endogenous insulinotropic peptide encoded in NUCB1.

TI  - Han Chinese polycystic ovary syndrome risk variants in women of European
      ancestry: relationship to FSH levels and glucose tolerance.
PG  - 1454-9
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dev085 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Are PCOS risk variants identified in women of Han Chinese
      ethnicity also associated with risk of PCOS or the phenotypic features of PCOS in
      European women? SUMMARY ANSWER: One variant, rs2268361-T, in the intron of FSHR
      was associated with PCOS and lower FSH levels, while another variant rs705702-G
      near the RAB5B and SUOX genes was associated with insulin and glucose levels
      after oral glucose testing in women with PCOS of European ethnicity. WHAT IS
      KNOWN ALREADY: Three of the eleven variants associated with PCOS in the Han
      Chinese genome-wide association studies were also associated with PCOS in at
      least one European population when corrected for multiple testing (DENND1A, THADA
      and YAP1). However, additional replication is needed to establish the importance 
      of these variants in European women and to determine the relationship to PCOS
      phenotypic traits. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was a case-control
      examination in a discovery cohort of women with PCOS (n = 485) and controls (n = 
      407) from Boston (Boston 1). Replication was performed in women from Greece
      (cases n = 884 and controls n = 311) and an additional cohort from Boston (Boston
      electronic medical record (EMR); n = 350 cases and n = 1258 controls).
      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: Women had PCOS defined by the National
      Institutes of Health criteria in Boston 1 and Greece (n = 783), with additional
      subjects fulfilling the Rotterdam criteria (hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovary
      morphology and regular menses) in Greece (n = 101). Controls in Boston and Greece
      had regular menstrual cycles and no hyperandrogenism. The second cohort from
      Boston was defined using the EMR and natural language processing. Allele
      frequencies for variants associated with PCOS in Han Chinese women were examined 
      in PCOS cases and controls, along with the relationship to quantitative traits.
      MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A variant rs2268361-T in an intron of FSHR
      was associated with PCOS (0.84 [0.76-0.93], OR [95% CI]; P = 0.002). The
      rs2268361-T was associated with lower FSH levels (-0.15 +/- 0.05; P = 0.0029). A 
      variant rs705702-G near RAB5B and SUOX was associated with insulin (-0.16 +/-
      0.05, P = 0.0029) and glucose levels (-0.20 +/- 0.05, P = 0.0002) 120 min after
      an oral glucose test. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The study was large and
      contained replication cohorts, but was limited by a small number of controls in
      the Greek cohort and a small number of cases in the second Boston cohort. The
      second Boston group was identified using electronic medical record review, but
      was validated for the cardinal features of PCOS. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE
      FINDINGS: This study demonstrates a cross-ethnic PCOS risk locus in FSHR in women
      of European ancestry with PCOS. The variant may influence FSH receptor
      responsiveness as suggested by the associated change in FSH levels. The
      relationship between a variant near RAB5B and SUOX and glucose stimulated insulin
      and glucose levels suggests an influence of one of these genes on glucose
      tolerance, but the absence of a relationship with PCOS points to potential
      differences in the international PCOS patient populations. STUDY

TI  - Microcystic macular edema in optic nerve atrophy: a case series.
PG  - 455-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1545797 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microcystic macular edema can occur after optic neuropathies of
      various etiologies, and is easily demonstrated by OCT. We report a cohort of
      patients with microcystic macular edema. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with 
      optic neuropathy and microcystic macular edema were enrolled. Demographics,
      visual function, retinal angiographies and OCT parameters were studied. RESULTS: 
      Nineteen patients (23 eyes) exhibited microcystic macular edema: 10 men/9 women, 
      aged 17-91 years. Etiologies of optic nerve atrophy were compressive (5),
      inflammatory (4), glaucoma (3), ischemic (3), trauma (2), degenerative (1), and
      hereditary (1). Median visual acuity was 4/10 (NLP-12/10). Fluorescein
      angiography showed no leakage. Topography of the microcystic macular edema
      correlated with near infrared images but with visual field defects in only 26%.
      OCT parameters were all abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: Microcystic macular edema is a
      non-specific manifestation from an optic neuropathy of any etiology. The precise 
      mechanism leading to microcystic macular edema remains unknown but trans-synaptic
      retrograde degeneration with Muller cells dysfunction is likely.

LID - 10.3892/mmr.2015.3650 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the effects of the centrosomal protein, ninein-like protein (Nlp),
      on the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the
      present study established green fluorescent protein (GFP)-containing MCF7
      plasmids with steady and overexpression of Nlp (MCG7-GFP-N1p) and blank plasmids 
      (MCF7-GFP) using lentiviral transfection technology in MCF7 the breast cancer
      cell line. The expression of Nlp was determined by reverse
      transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blott analysis. 
      Differences in levels of proliferation, invasion and metastasis between the
      MCF7-GFP-Nlp group and MCF-GFP group were compared using MTT, plate colony
      formation and Transwell migration assays. The cell growth was more rapid and the 
      colony forming rate was markedly increased in the MCF7-GFP-Nlp group (P<0.05)
      compared with the MCF7-GFP group. The number of cells in the MCF-GFP-Nlp and
      MCF7-GFP groups transferred across membranes were 878 +/- 18.22 and 398 +/- 8.02,
      respectively, in the migration assay. The invasive capacity was significantly
      increased in the MCF7-GFP-Nlp group (P<0.05) compared with the MCF7-GFP group.
      The western blotting results demonstrated high expression levels of C-X-C
      chemokine receptor type 4 in the MCF7-GFP-Nlp group. The increased expression of 
      Nlp was associated with an increase in MCF7 cell proliferation, invasion and
      metastasis, which indicated that Nlp promoted breast tumorigenesis and may be
      used as a potent biological index to predict breast cancer metastasis and develop
      therapeutic regimes.

TI  - TFF2-CXCR4 Axis Is Associated with BRAF V600E Colon Cancer.
PG  - 614-9
LID - 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-14-0444 [doi]
AB  - Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a tumor-suppressive mechanism that is induced 
      by the replicative and metabolic stress of oncogene activation, is a key barrier 
      in the development of BRAF V600E colon cancer. Inhibition of this mechanism has
      been observed through epigenetic changes observed in sporadic serrated polyps, as
      well as through the germline mutations associated with those who develop serrated
      polyposis. We hypothesize that upregulated autocrine factors exist that are
      specific to the serrated pathway and also promote bypass of oncogene-induced
      senescence. To identify such autocrine factors, we integrate analyses of
      microarrays of sessile serrated polyps and two large colon cancer cohorts, the
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 153), and French national Cartes d'Identite des
      Tumeurs (CIT) program (n = 462), with enhanced gene annotation through natural
      language processing techniques of the existing medical corpus. We reproducibly
      associate higher expression of the ligand-receptor axis of TFF2 and CXCR4 with
      BRAF V600E-mutant colon cancer (P = 3.0 x 10(-3) and 0.077, respectively for
      TCGA; P = 3.0 x 10(-8) and 5.1 x 10(-7) for CIT). Given well-described oncogenic 
      roles of TFF2 and CXCR4 in colon cancer, and availability of CXCR4 inhibitors for
      other clinical indications, this ligand-receptor axis may represent an actionable
      target for prevention and treatment of this molecular subtype of colorectal
      cancer.

TI  - An opioid-like system regulating feeding behavior in C. elegans.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.06683 [doi]
AB  - Neuropeptides are essential for the regulation of appetite. Here we show that
      neuropeptides could regulate feeding in mutants that lack neurotransmission from 
      the motor neurons that stimulate feeding muscles. We identified nlp-24 by an RNAi
      screen of 115 neuropeptide genes, testing whether they affected growth. NLP-24
      peptides have a conserved YGGXX sequence, similar to mammalian opioid
      neuropeptides. In addition, morphine and naloxone respectively stimulated and
      inhibited feeding in starved worms, but not in worms lacking NPR-17, which
      encodes a protein with sequence similarity to opioid receptors. Opioid agonists
      activated heterologously expressed NPR-17, as did at least one NLP-24 peptide.
      Worms lacking the ASI neurons, which express npr-17, did not response to
      naloxone. Thus, we suggest that Caenorhabditis elegans has an endogenous opioid
      system that acts through NPR-17, and that opioids regulate feeding via ASI
      neurons. Together, these results suggest C. elegans may be the first genetically 
      tractable invertebrate opioid model.

TI  - Transcriptional landscape of psoriasis identifies the involvement of IL36 and
      IL36RN.
PG  - 322
LID - 10.1186/s12864-015-1508-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In present study we performed whole transcriptome analysis in plaque 
      psoriasis patients and compared lesional skin with non-lesional skin and with the
      skin from healthy controls. We sequenced total RNA from 12 lesional (LP), 12
      non-lesional (NLP) and from 12 normal (C) skin biopsies. RESULTS: Compared with
      previous gene expression profiling studies we had three groups under analysis -
      LP, NLP and C. Using NLP samples allows to see the transcriptome of visually
      normal skin from psoriasis patient. In LP skin S100A12, S100A7A, LCE3E, DEFB4A,
      IL19 were found up regulated. In addition to already these well-described genes, 
      we also found several other genes related to psoriasis. Namely, KLK9, OAS2, OAS3,
      PLA2G, IL36G, IL36RN were found to be significantly and consistently related to
      the psoriatic lesions and this finding is supported also by previous studies. The
      genes up-regulated in the LP samples were related to the innate immunity, IL17
      and IL10 networks. In NLP samples innate immunity and IL17 network were
      activated, but activation of IL10 network was not evident. The transcriptional
      changes characteristic in the NLP samples can be considered as a molecular
      signature of "dormant psoriasis". CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study
      described the transcriptome profile characteristic for LP and NLP psoriatic skin.
      RNA profile of the NLP skin is in between the lesional and healthy skin, with its
      own specific pattern. We found that both LP and NLP have up-regulated IL17
      network, whereas LP skin has up regulated IL10 related cytokines (IL19, IL20,
      IL24). Moreover, IL36G and IL36RN were identified as strong regulators of skin
      pathology in both LP and NLP skin samples, with stronger influence in LP samples.

TI  - Eliciting and receiving online support: using computer-aided content analysis to 
      examine the dynamics of online social support.
PG  - e99
LID - 10.2196/jmir.3558 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many people with serious diseases participate in online
      support communities, little research has investigated how participants elicit and
      provide social support on these sites. OBJECTIVE: The first goal was to propose
      and test a model of the dynamic process through which participants in online
      support communities elicit and provide emotional and informational support. The
      second was to demonstrate the value of computer coding of conversational data
      using machine learning techniques (1) by replicating results derived from
      human-coded data about how people elicit support and (2) by answering questions
      that are intractable with small samples of human-coded data, namely how exposure 
      to different types of social support predicts continued participation in online
      support communities. The third was to provide a detailed description of these
      machine learning techniques to enable other researchers to perform large-scale
      data analysis in these communities. METHODS: Communication among approximately
      90,000 registered users of an online cancer support community was analyzed. The
      corpus comprised 1,562,459 messages organized into 68,158 discussion threads.
      Amazon Mechanical Turk workers coded (1) 1000 thread-starting messages on 5
      attributes (positive and negative emotional self-disclosure, positive and
      negative informational self-disclosure, questions) and (2) 1000 replies on
      emotional and informational support. Their judgments were used to train machine
      learning models that automatically estimated the amount of these 7 attributes in 
      the messages. Across attributes, the average Pearson correlation between
      human-based judgments and computer-based judgments was .65. RESULTS: Part 1 used 
      human-coded data to investigate relationships between (1) 4 kinds of
      self-disclosure and question asking in thread-starting posts and (2) the amount
      of emotional and informational support in the first reply. Self-disclosure about 
      negative emotions (beta=.24, P<.001), negative events (beta=.25, P<.001), and
      positive events (beta=.10, P=.02) increased emotional support. However, asking
      questions depressed emotional support (beta=-.21, P<.001). In contrast, asking
      questions increased informational support (beta=.38, P<.001), whereas positive
      informational self-disclosure depressed it (beta=-.09, P=.003). Self-disclosure
      led to the perception of emotional needs, which elicited emotional support,
      whereas asking questions led to the perception of informational needs, which
      elicited informational support. Part 2 used machine-coded data to replicate these
      results. Part 3 analyzed the machine-coded data and showed that exposure to more 
      emotional support predicted staying in the group longer 33% (hazard ratio=0.67,
      P<.001), whereas exposure to more informational support predicted leaving the
      group sooner (hazard ratio=1.05, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-disclosure is
      effective in eliciting emotional support, whereas question asking is effective in
      eliciting informational support. Moreover, perceptions that people desire
      particular kinds of support influence the support they receive. Finally, the type
      of support people receive affects the likelihood of their staying in or leaving
      the group. These results demonstrate the utility of machine learning methods for 
      investigating the dynamics of social support exchange in online support
      communities.

AB  - Depression is a disease that can dramatically lower quality of life. Symptoms of 
      depression can range from temporary sadness to suicide. Embarrassment, shyness,
      and the stigma of depression are some of the factors preventing people from
      getting help for their problems. Contemporary social media technologies like
      Internet forums or micro-blogs give people the opportunity to talk about their
      feelings in a confidential anonymous environment. However, many participants in
      such networks may not recognize the severity of their depression and their need
      for professional help. Our approach is to develop a method that detects symptoms 
      of depression in free text, such as posts in Internet forums, chat rooms and the 
      like. This could help people appreciate the significance of their depression and 
      realize they need to seek help. In this work Natural Language Processing methods 
      are used to break the textual information into its grammatical units. Further
      analysis involves detection of depression symptoms and their frequency with the
      help of words known as indicators of depression and their synonyms. Finally,
      similar to common paper-based depression scales, e.g., the CES-D, that
      information is incorporated into a single depression score. In this evaluation
      study, our depressive mood detection system, DepreSD (Depression Symptom
      Detection), had an average precision of 0.84 (range 0.72-1.0 depending on the
      specific measure) and an average F measure of 0.79 (range 0.72-0.9).

TI  - Non-redundant association rules between diseases and medications: an automated
      method for knowledge base construction.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s12911-015-0151-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) has generated 
      massive clinical data storage. Association rules mining is a feasible technique
      to convert this large amount of data into usable knowledge for clinical decision 
      making, research or billing. We present a data driven method to create a
      knowledge base linking medications to pathological conditions through their
      therapeutic indications from elements within the EHRs. METHODS: Association rules
      were created from the data of patients hospitalised between May 2012 and May 2013
      in the department of Cardiology at the University Hospital of Strasbourg.
      Medications were extracted from the medication list, and the pathological
      conditions were extracted from the discharge summaries using a natural language
      processing tool. Association rules were generated along with different
      interestingness measures: chi square, lift, conviction, dependency, novelty and
      satisfaction. All medication-disease pairs were compared to the Summary of
      Product Characteristics, which is the gold standard. A score based on the other
      interestingness measures was created to filter the best rules, and the indices
      were calculated for the different interestingness measures. RESULTS: After the
      evaluation against the gold standard, a list of accurate association rules was
      successfully retrieved. Dependency represents the best recall (0.76). Our score
      exhibited higher exactness (0.84) and precision (0.27) than all of the others
      interestingness measures. Further reductions in noise produced by this method
      must be performed to improve the classification precision. CONCLUSIONS:
      Association rules mining using the unstructured elements of the EHR is a feasible
      technique to identify clinically accurate associations between medications and
      pathological conditions.

TI  - A missense mutation in the agouti signaling protein gene (ASIP) is associated
      with the no light points coat phenotype in donkeys.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s12711-015-0112-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seven donkey breeds are recognized by the French studbook and are
      characterized by a black, bay or grey coat colour including light cream-to-white 
      points (LP). Occasionally, Normand bay donkeys give birth to dark foals that lack
      LP and display the no light points (NLP) pattern. This pattern is more frequent
      and officially recognized in American miniature donkeys. The LP (or pangare)
      phenotype resembles that of the light bellied agouti pattern in mouse, while the 
      NLP pattern resembles that of the mammalian recessive black phenotype; both
      phenotypes are associated with the agouti signaling protein gene (ASIP).
      FINDINGS: We used a panel of 127 donkeys to identify a recessive missense c.349 T
      > C variant in ASIP that was shown to be in complete association with the NLP
      phenotype. This variant results in a cysteine to arginine substitution at
      position 117 in the ASIP protein. This cysteine is highly-conserved among
      vertebrate ASIP proteins and was previously shown by mutagenesis experiments to
      lie within a functional site. Altogether, our results strongly support that the
      identified mutation is causative of the NLP phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we
      propose to name the c.[349 T > C] allele in donkeys, the a(nlp) allele, which
      enlarges the panel of coat colour alleles in donkeys and ASIP recessive
      loss-of-function alleles in animals.

TI  - Identifying named entities from PubMed for enriching semantic categories.
PG  - 57
LID - 10.1186/s12859-015-0487-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled vocabularies such as the Unified Medical Language System
      (UMLS) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are widely used for biomedical natural
      language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the standard terminology in such
      collections suffers from low usage in biomedical literature, e.g. only 13% of
      UMLS terms appear in MEDLINE. RESULTS: We here propose an efficient and effective
      method for extracting noun phrases for biomedical semantic categories. The
      proposed approach utilizes simple linguistic patterns to select candidate noun
      phrases based on headwords, and a machine learning classifier is used to filter
      out noisy phrases. For experiments, three NLP rules were tested and manually
      evaluated by three annotators. Our approaches showed over 93% precision on
      average for the headwords, "gene", "protein", "disease", "cell" and "cells".
      CONCLUSIONS: Although biomedical terms in knowledge-rich resources may define
      semantic categories, variations of the controlled terms in literature are still
      difficult to identify. The method proposed here is an effort to narrow the gap
      between controlled vocabularies and the entities used in text. Our extraction
      method cannot completely eliminate manual evaluation, however a simple and
      automated solution with high precision performance provides a convenient way for 
      enriching semantic categories by incorporating terms obtained from the
      literature.

TI  - Effect of oral melatonin and wearing earplugs and eye masks on nocturnal sleep in
      healthy subjects in a simulated intensive care unit environment: which might be a
      more promising strategy for ICU sleep deprivation?
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/s13054-015-0842-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sleep deprivation is common in critically ill patients in the
      intensive care unit (ICU). Noise and light in the ICU and the reduction in plasma
      melatonin play the essential roles. The aim of this study was to determine the
      effect of simulated ICU noise and light on nocturnal sleep quality, and compare
      the effectiveness of melatonin and earplugs and eye masks on sleep quality in
      these conditions in healthy subjects. METHODS: This study was conducted in two
      parts. In part one, 40 healthy subjects slept under baseline night and simulated 
      ICU noise and light (NL) by a cross-over design. In part two, 40 subjects were
      randomly assigned to four groups: NL, NL plus placebo (NLP), NL plus use of
      earplugs and eye masks (NLEE) and NL plus melatonin (NLM). 1 mg of oral melatonin
      or placebo was administered at 21:00 on four consecutive days in NLM and NLP.
      Earplugs and eye masks were made available in NLEE. The objective sleep quality
      was measured by polysomnography. Serum was analyzed for melatonin levels.
      Subjects rated their perceived sleep quality and anxiety levels. RESULTS:
      Subjects had shorter total sleep time (TST) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,
      longer sleep onset latency, more light sleep and awakening, poorer subjective
      sleep quality, higher anxiety level and lower serum melatonin level in NL night
      (P <0.05). NLEE had less awakenings and shorter sleep onset latency (P <0.05).
      NLM had longer TST and REM and shorter sleep onset latency (P <0.05). Compared
      with NLEE, NLM had fewer awakenings (P = 0.004). Both NLM and NLEE improved
      perceived sleep quality and anxiety level (P = 0.000), and NLM showed better than
      NLEE in perceived sleep quality (P = 0.01). Compared to baseline night, the serum
      melatonin levels were lower in NL night at every time point, and the average
      maximal serum melatonin concentration in NLM group was significantly greater than
      other groups (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with earplugs and eye masks,
      melatonin improves sleep quality and serum melatonin levels better in healthy
      subjects exposed to simulated ICU noise and light. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese

TI  - The characteristics and health needs of pregnant women with schizophrenia
      compared with bipolar disorder and affective psychoses.
PG  - 88
LID - 10.1186/s12888-015-0451-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most women with psychotic disorders and bipolar disorders have
      children but their pregnancies are at risk of adverse psychiatric and fetal
      outcome. The extent of modifiable risk factors - both clinical and
      socio-demographic - is unclear as most studies have used administrative data or
      recruited from specialist tertiary referral clinics. We therefore aimed to
      investigate the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of an
      epidemiologically representative cohort of pregnant women with affective and
      non-affective severe mental illness. METHODS: Women with severe mental illness
      were identified from a large electronic mental health case register in south
      London, and a data linkage with national maternity Hospital Episode Statistics
      identified pregnancies in 2007-2011. Data were extracted using structured fields,
      text searching and natural language processing applications. RESULTS: Of 456
      pregnant women identified, 236 (51.7%) had schizophrenia and related disorders,
      220 (48.3%) had affective psychosis or bipolar disorder. Women with schizophrenia
      and related disorders were younger, less likely to have a partner in pregnancy,
      more likely to be black, to smoke or misuse substances and had significantly more
      time in the two years before pregnancy in acute care (inpatient or intensive home
      treatment) compared with women with affective disorders. Both groups had high
      levels of domestic abuse in pregnancy (recorded in 18.9%), were from relatively
      deprived backgrounds and had impaired functioning measured by the Health of the
      Nation Outcome Scale. Women in the affective group were more likely to stop
      medication in the first trimester (39% versus 25%) whereas women with
      non-affective psychoses were more likely to switch medication. CONCLUSIONS: A
      significant proportion of women, particularly those with non-affective psychoses,
      have modifiable risk factors requiring tailored care to optimize pregnancy
      outcomes. Mental health professionals need to be mindful of the possibility of
      pregnancy in women of childbearing age and prescribe and address modifiable risk 
      factors accordingly.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This review examines work on automated summarization of electronic
      health record (EHR) data and in particular, individual patient record
      summarization. We organize the published research and highlight methodological
      challenges in the area of EHR summarization implementation. TARGET AUDIENCE: The 
      target audience for this review includes researchers, designers, and
      informaticians who are concerned about the problem of information overload in the
      clinical setting as well as both users and developers of clinical summarization
      systems. SCOPE: Automated summarization has been a long-studied subject in the
      fields of natural language processing and human-computer interaction, but the
      translation of summarization and visualization methods to the complexity of the
      clinical workflow is slow moving. We assess work in aggregating and visualizing
      patient information with a particular focus on methods for detecting and removing
      redundancy, describing temporality, determining salience, accounting for missing 
      data, and taking advantage of encoded clinical knowledge. We identify and discuss
      open challenges critical to the implementation and use of robust EHR
      summarization systems.

TI  - Increasing the efficiency of trial-patient matching: automated clinical trial
      eligibility pre-screening for pediatric oncology patients.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s12911-015-0149-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Manual eligibility screening (ES) for a clinical trial typically
      requires a labor-intensive review of patient records that utilizes many
      resources. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and
      information extraction (IE) technologies, we sought to improve the efficiency of 
      physician decision-making in clinical trial enrollment. In order to markedly
      reduce the pool of potential candidates for staff screening, we developed an
      automated ES algorithm to identify patients who meet core eligibility
      characteristics of an oncology clinical trial. METHODS: We collected narrative
      eligibility criteria from ClinicalTrials.gov for 55 clinical trials actively
      enrolling oncology patients in our institution between 12/01/2009 and 10/31/2011.
      In parallel, our ES algorithm extracted clinical and demographic information from
      the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data fields to represent profiles of all 215
      oncology patients admitted to cancer treatment during the same period. The
      automated ES algorithm then matched the trial criteria with the patient profiles 
      to identify potential trial-patient matches. Matching performance was validated
      on a reference set of 169 historical trial-patient enrollment decisions, and
      workload, precision, recall, negative predictive value (NPV) and specificity were
      calculated. RESULTS: Without automation, an oncologist would need to review 163
      patients per trial on average to replicate the historical patient enrollment for 
      each trial. This workload is reduced by 85% to 24 patients when using automated
      ES (precision/recall/NPV/specificity: 12.6%/100.0%/100.0%/89.9%). Without
      automation, an oncologist would need to review 42 trials per patient on average
      to replicate the patient-trial matches that occur in the retrospective data set. 
      With automated ES this workload is reduced by 90% to four trials
      (precision/recall/NPV/specificity: 35.7%/100.0%/100.0%/95.5%). CONCLUSION: By
      leveraging NLP and IE technologies, automated ES could dramatically increase the 
      trial screening efficiency of oncologists and enable participation of small
      practices, which are often left out from trial enrollment. The algorithm has the 
      potential to significantly reduce the effort to execute clinical research at a
      point in time when new initiatives of the cancer care community intend to greatly
      expand both the access to trials and the number of available trials.

TI  - Learning document semantic representation with hybrid deep belief network.
PG  - 650527
LID - 10.1155/2015/650527 [doi]
AB  - High-level abstraction, for example, semantic representation, is vital for
      document classification and retrieval. However, how to learn document semantic
      representation is still a topic open for discussion in information retrieval and 
      natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a new Hybrid Deep Belief
      Network (HDBN) which uses Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) on the lower layers
      together with Deep Belief Network (DBN) on the upper layers. The advantage of DBM
      is that it employs undirected connection when training weight parameters which
      can be used to sample the states of nodes on each layer more successfully and it 
      is also an effective way to remove noise from the different document
      representation type; the DBN can enhance extract abstract of the document in
      depth, making the model learn sufficient semantic representation. At the same
      time, we explore different input strategies for semantic distributed
      representation. Experimental results show that our model using the word embedding
      instead of single word has better performance.

TI  - Automated concept and relationship extraction for the semi-automated ontology
      management (SEAM) system.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/s13326-015-0011-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We develop medical-specialty specific ontologies that contain the
      settled science and common term usage. We leverage current practices in
      information and relationship extraction to streamline the ontology development
      process. Our system combines different text types with information and
      relationship extraction techniques in a low overhead modifiable system. Our
      SEmi-Automated ontology Maintenance (SEAM) system features a natural language
      processing pipeline for information extraction. Synonym and hierarchical groups
      are identified using corpus-based semantics and lexico-syntactic patterns. The
      semantic vectors we use are term frequency by inverse document frequency and
      context vectors. Clinical documents contain the terms we want in an ontology.
      They also contain idiosyncratic usage and are unlikely to contain the linguistic 
      constructs associated with synonym and hierarchy identification. By including
      both clinical and biomedical texts, SEAM can recommend terms from those appearing
      in both document types. The set of recommended terms is then used to filter the
      synonyms and hierarchical relationships extracted from the biomedical corpus. We 
      demonstrate the generality of the system across three use cases: ontologies for
      acute changes in mental status, Medically Unexplained Syndromes, and
      echocardiogram summary statements. RESULTS: Across the three uses cases, we held 
      the number of recommended terms relatively constant by changing SEAM's
      parameters. Experts seem to find more than 300 recommended terms to be
      overwhelming. The approval rate of recommended terms increased as the number and 
      specificity of clinical documents in the corpus increased. It was 60% when there 
      were 199 clinical documents that were not specific to the ontology domain and 90%
      when there were 2879 documents very specific to the target domain. We found that 
      fewer than 100 recommended synonym groups were also preferred. Approval rates for
      synonym recommendations remained low varying from 43% to 25% as the number of
      journal articles increased from 19 to 47. Overall the number of recommended
      hierarchical relationships was very low although approval was good. It varied
      between 67% and 31%. CONCLUSION: SEAM produced a concise list of recommended
      clinical terms, synonyms and hierarchical relationships regardless of medical
      domain.

TI  - Platelet to lymphocyte ratio and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in patients with 
      rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 249-253
LID - 10.1515/med-2015-0037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It has been well documented that the platelet to lymphocyte ratio
      (PLR) and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are associated with outcomes
      for patients with gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and acute heart
      failure. Inflammation may be the hidden factor that explains the correlation
      between NLP, PLR, and these diseases. However, to date, the data concerning NLR, 
      PLR, and its association with inflammation are lacking in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), thus, our aim to discuss whether NLR and PLR are
      associated with RA. METHODS: Patients with RA and healthy individuals were
      included according to the determined criteria, and laboratory indicators were
      measured. RESULTS: PLR and NLR were significantly higher in RA patients compared 
      with healthy controls (3.20+/-2.06 vs. 1.56+/-0.47, P<0.01; 192.85+/-101.78 vs.
      103.49+/-28.68, P<0.01). When leukocytes, neutrophil percentage, neutrophil,
      lymphocyte, platelet, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate
      (ESR), and rheumatoid factor (RF) were considered as confounders (crude model),
      our results indicated that ESR and RF were correlated to RA. Of note, ESR, RF,
      and PLR were associated with RA after further adjustment based on crude model for
      PLR and NLR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis showed that 
      PLR values higher than >115.7 evaluated RA with a sensitivity of 82.5%, a
      specificity of 74.8% and area under the curve ( AUC ) of 0.847. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results suggest that PLR is associated with RA, and PLR may be an underlying
      indicator indicating the chronic subclinical inflammation in patients with RA.

TI  - Prioritization of free-text clinical documents: a novel use of a bayesian
      classifier.
PG  - e17
LID - 10.2196/medinform.3793 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The amount of incoming data into physicians' offices is increasing,
      thereby making it difficult to process information efficiently and accurately to 
      maximize positive patient outcomes. Current manual processes of screening for
      individual terms within long free-text documents are tedious and error-prone.
      This paper explores the use of statistical methods and computer systems to assist
      clinical data management. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to verify
      and validate the use of a naive Bayesian classifier as a means of properly
      prioritizing important clinical data, specifically that of free-text radiology
      reports. METHODS: There were one hundred reports that were first used to train
      the algorithm based on physicians' categorization of clinical reports as
      high-priority or low-priority. Then, the algorithm was used to evaluate 354
      reports. Additional beautification procedures such as section extraction, text
      preprocessing, and negation detection were performed. RESULTS: The algorithm
      evaluated the 354 reports with discrimination between high-priority and
      low-priority reports, resulting in a bimodal probability distribution. In all
      scenarios tested, the false negative rates were below 1.1% and the recall rates
      ranged from 95.65% to 98.91%. In the case of 50% prior probability and 80%
      threshold probability, the accuracy of this Bayesian classifier was 93.50%, with 
      a positive predictive value (precision) of 80.54%. It also showed a sensitivity
      (recall) of 98.91% and a F-measure of 88.78%. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed
      that the algorithm could be trained to detect abnormal radiology results by
      accurately screening clinical reports. Such a technique can potentially be used
      to enable automatic flagging of critical results. In addition to accuracy, the
      algorithm was able to minimize false negatives, which is important for clinical
      applications. We conclude that a Bayesian statistical classifier, by flagging
      reports with abnormal findings, can assist a physician in reviewing radiology
      reports more efficiently. This higher level of prioritization allows physicians
      to address important radiologic findings in a timelier manner and may also aid in
      minimizing errors of omission.

TI  - Subgraph augmented non-negative tensor factorization (SANTF) for modeling
      clinical narrative text.
PG  - 1009-19
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Extracting medical knowledge from electronic medical records requires 
      automated approaches to combat scalability limitations and selection biases.
      However, existing machine learning approaches are often regarded by clinicians as
      black boxes. Moreover, training data for these automated approaches at often
      sparsely annotated at best. The authors target unsupervised learning for modeling
      clinical narrative text, aiming at improving both accuracy and interpretability. 
      METHODS: The authors introduce a novel framework named subgraph augmented
      non-negative tensor factorization (SANTF). In addition to relying on atomic
      features (e.g., words in clinical narrative text), SANTF automatically mines
      higher-order features (e.g., relations of lymphoid cells expressing antigens)
      from clinical narrative text by converting sentences into a graph representation 
      and identifying important subgraphs. The authors compose a tensor using patients,
      higher-order features, and atomic features as its respective modes. We then apply
      non-negative tensor factorization to cluster patients, and simultaneously
      identify latent groups of higher-order features that link to patient clusters, as
      in clinical guidelines where a panel of immunophenotypic features and laboratory 
      results are used to specify diagnostic criteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: SANTF
      demonstrated over 10% improvement in averaged F-measure on patient clustering
      compared to widely used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and k-means
      clustering methods. Multiple baselines were established by modeling patient data 
      using patient-by-features matrices with different feature configurations and then
      performing NMF or k-means to cluster patients. Feature analysis identified latent
      groups of higher-order features that lead to medical insights. We also found that
      the latent groups of atomic features help to better correlate the latent groups
      of higher-order features.

TI  - An Evaluation of Patient Safety Event Report Categories Using Unsupervised Topic 
      Modeling.
PG  - 338-45
LID - 10.3414/ME15-01-0010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patient safety event data repositories have the potential to
      dramatically improve safety if analyzed and leveraged appropriately. These safety
      event reports often consist of both structured data, such as general event type
      categories, and unstructured data, such as free text descriptions of the event.
      Analyzing these data, particularly the rich free text narratives, can be
      challenging, especially with tens of thousands of reports. To overcome the
      resource intensive manual review process of the free text descriptions, we
      demonstrate the effectiveness of using an unsupervised natural language
      processing approach. METHODS: An unsupervised natural language processing
      technique, called topic modeling, was applied to a large repository of patient
      safety event data to identify topics, or themes, from the free text descriptions 
      of the data. Entropy measures were used to evaluate and compare these topics to
      the general event type categories that were originally assigned by the event
      reporter. RESULTS: Measures of entropy demonstrated that some topics generated
      from the unsupervised modeling approach aligned with the clinical general event
      type categories that were originally selected by the individual entering the
      report. Importantly, several new latent topics emerged that were not originally
      identified. The new topics provide additional insights into the patient safety
      event data that would not otherwise easily be detected. CONCLUSION: The topic
      modeling approach provides a method to identify topics or themes that may not be 
      immediately apparent and has the potential to allow for automatic
      reclassification of events that are ambiguously classified by the event re-
      porter.

TI  - Social media as a sensor of air quality and public response in China.
PG  - e22
LID - 10.2196/jmir.3875 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of social media data
      sources for a wide range of public health goals, including disease surveillance, 
      mental health trends, and health perceptions and sentiment. Most such research
      has focused on English-language social media for the task of disease
      surveillance. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the value of Chinese social media for
      monitoring air quality trends and related public perceptions and response. The
      goal was to determine if this data is suitable for learning actionable
      information about pollution levels and public response. METHODS: We mined a
      collection of 93 million messages from Sina Weibo, China's largest microblogging 
      service. We experimented with different filters to identify messages relevant to 
      air quality, based on keyword matching and topic modeling. We evaluated the
      reliability of the data filters by comparing message volume per city to air
      particle pollution rates obtained from the Chinese government for 74 cities.
      Additionally, we performed a qualitative study of the content of
      pollution-related messages by coding a sample of 170 messages for relevance to
      air quality, and whether the message included details such as a reactive behavior
      or a health concern. RESULTS: The volume of pollution-related messages is highly 
      correlated with particle pollution levels, with Pearson correlation values up to 
      .718 (n=74, P<.001). Our qualitative results found that 67.1% (114/170) of
      messages were relevant to air quality and of those, 78.9% (90/114) were a
      firsthand report. Of firsthand reports, 28% (32/90) indicated a reactive behavior
      and 19% (17/90) expressed a health concern. Additionally, 3 messages of 170
      requested that action be taken to improve quality. CONCLUSIONS: We have found
      quantitatively that message volume in Sina Weibo is indicative of true particle
      pollution levels, and we have found qualitatively that messages contain rich
      details including perceptions, behaviors, and self-reported health effects.
      Social media data can augment existing air pollution surveillance data,
      especially perception and health-related data that traditionally requires
      expensive surveys or interviews.

TI  - Validation of electronic health record phenotyping of bipolar disorder cases and 
      controls.
PG  - 363-72
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.14030423 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to validate use of electronic health records
      (EHRs) for diagnosing bipolar disorder and classifying control subjects. METHOD: 
      EHR data were obtained from a health care system of more than 4.6 million
      patients spanning more than 20 years. Experienced clinicians reviewed charts to
      identify text features and coded data consistent or inconsistent with a diagnosis
      of bipolar disorder. Natural language processing was used to train a diagnostic
      algorithm with 95% specificity for classifying bipolar disorder. Filtered coded
      data were used to derive three additional classification rules for case subjects 
      and one for control subjects. The positive predictive value (PPV) of EHR-based
      bipolar disorder and subphenotype diagnoses was calculated against diagnoses from
      direct semistructured interviews of 190 patients by trained clinicians blind to
      EHR diagnosis. RESULTS: The PPV of bipolar disorder defined by natural language
      processing was 0.85. Coded classification based on strict filtering achieved a
      value of 0.79, but classifications based on less stringent criteria performed
      less well. No EHR-classified control subject received a diagnosis of bipolar
      disorder on the basis of direct interview (PPV=1.0). For most subphenotypes,
      values exceeded 0.80. The EHR-based classifications were used to accrue 4,500
      bipolar disorder cases and 5,000 controls for genetic analyses. CONCLUSIONS:
      Semiautomated mining of EHRs can be used to ascertain bipolar disorder patients
      and control subjects with high specificity and predictive value compared with
      diagnostic interviews. EHRs provide a powerful resource for high-throughput
      phenotyping for genetic and clinical research.

TI  - A clinical perspective on the relevance of research domain criteria in electronic
      health records.
PG  - 316-20

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The limitations of the DSM nosology for capturing dimensionality and
      overlap in psychiatric syndromes, and its poor correspondence to underlying
      neurobiology, have been well established. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a 
      proposed dimensional model of psychopathology, may offer new insights into
      psychiatric illness. For psychiatric clinicians, however, because tools for
      capturing these domains in clinical practice have not yet been established, the
      relevance and means of transition from the categorical system of DSM-5 to the
      dimensional models of RDoC remains unclear. The authors explored a method of
      extracting these dimensions from existing electronic health record (EHR) notes.
      METHOD: The authors used information retrieval and natural language processing
      methods to extract estimates of the RDoC dimensions in the EHRs of a large health
      system. They parsed and scored EHR documentation for 2,484 admissions covering
      2,010 patients admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 2011 and 2013.
      These domain scores were compared with DSM-IV-based ICD-9 codes to assess face
      validity. As a measure of predictive validity, these scores were examined for
      association with two outcomes: length of hospital stay and time to all-cause
      hospital readmission. Together, these analyses were intended to address the
      extent to which RDoC symptom domains might capture clinical features already
      available in narrative notes but not reflected in DSM diagnoses. RESULTS: In
      mixed-effects models, loadings for the RDoC cognitive and arousal domains were
      associated with length of hospital stay, while the negative valence and social
      domains were associated with hazard of all-cause hospital readmission.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that a computationally derived tool based on
      RDoC workgroup reports identifies symptom distributions in clinician notes beyond
      those captured by ICD-9 codes, and these domains have significant predictive
      validity. More generally, they point to the possibility that clinicians already
      document RDoC-relevant symptoms, albeit not in a quantified form.

TI  - A unified statistical approach to non-negative matrix factorization and
      probabilistic latent semantic indexing.
PG  - 137-163
AB  - Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful machine learning method for
      decomposing a high-dimensional nonnegative matrix V into the product of two
      nonnegative matrices, W and H, such that V approximately W H. It has been shown
      to have a parts-based, sparse representation of the data. NMF has been
      successfully applied in a variety of areas such as natural language processing,
      neuroscience, information retrieval, image processing, speech recognition and
      computational biology for the analysis and interpretation of large-scale data.
      There has also been simultaneous development of a related statistical latent
      class modeling approach, namely, probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI),
      for analyzing and interpreting co-occurrence count data arising in natural
      language processing. In this paper, we present a generalized statistical approach
      to NMF and PLSI based on Renyi's divergence between two non-negative matrices,
      stemming from the Poisson likelihood. Our approach unifies various competing
      models and provides a unique theoretical framework for these methods. We propose 
      a unified algorithm for NMF and provide a rigorous proof of monotonicity of
      multiplicative updates for W and H. In addition, we generalize the relationship
      between NMF and PLSI within this framework. We demonstrate the applicability and 
      utility of our approach as well as its superior performance relative to existing 
      methods using real-life and simulated document clustering data.

TI  - Role of PMK-1/p38 MAPK defense in Caenorhabditis elegans against Klebsiella

LID - ftv021 [pii]
AB  - The present study reports that Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) killed the
      Caenorhabditis elegans as a consequence of an accumulation and proliferation of
      the pathogen inside the worms' intestine. The real-time PCR analysis of the genes
      responsible for vulval development (let-23) and egg laying (lin-29) in KP
      infected C. elegans confirmed the reproductive defects provoked by KP at the
      molecular level. In addition, the genetic analysis in N2 wild type, tol-1, sek-1 
      and pmk-1 mutants unveiled that KP attenuates the toll-dependent p38
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) by chiefly inhibiting the production 
      of antimicrobial factors such as nlp-29, lys-1 and C-type lectins. Conclusively, 
      the surrendering of the host immune system appears to be attenuated by the
      toll-dependent p38 MAPK pathway regulation in C. elegans.

TI  - Different neuropeptides are expressed in different functional subsets of
      cholinergic excitatory motorneurons in the nematode Ascaris suum.
PG  - 855-70
LID - 10.1021/cn5003623 [doi]
AB  - Neuropeptides are known to have dramatic effects on neurons and synapses;
      however, despite extensive studies of the motorneurons in the parasitic nematode 
      Ascaris suum, their peptide content had not yet been described. We determined the
      peptide content of single excitatory motorneurons by mass spectrometry and tandem
      mass spectrometry. There are two subsets of ventral cord excitatory motorneurons,
      each with neuromuscular output either anterior or posterior to their cell body,
      mediating forward or backward locomotion, respectively. Strikingly, the two sets 
      of neurons contain different neuropeptides, with AF9 and six novel peptides
      (As-NLP-21.1-6) in anterior projectors, and the six afp-1 peptides in addition to
      AF2 in posterior projectors. In situ hybridization confirmed the expression of
      these peptides, validating the integrity of the dissection technique. This work
      identifies new components of the functional behavioral circuit, as well as
      potential targets for antiparasitic drug development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemical and biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an
      essential prerequisite task before effective text mining can begin for
      biochemical-text data. Exploiting unlabeled text data to leverage system
      performance has been an active and challenging research topic in text mining due 
      to the recent growth in the amount of biomedical literature. We present a
      semi-supervised learning method that efficiently exploits unlabeled data in order
      to incorporate domain knowledge into a named entity recognition model and to
      leverage system performance. The proposed method includes Natural Language
      Processing (NLP) tasks for text preprocessing, learning word representation
      features from a large amount of text data for feature extraction, and conditional
      random fields for token classification. Other than the free text in the domain,
      the proposed method does not rely on any lexicon nor any dictionary in order to
      keep the system applicable to other NER tasks in bio-text data. RESULTS: We
      extended BANNER, a biomedical NER system, with the proposed method. This yields
      an integrated system that can be applied to chemical and drug NER or biomedical
      NER. We call our branch of the BANNER system BANNER-CHEMDNER, which is scalable
      over millions of documents, processing about 530 documents per minute, is
      configurable via XML, and can be plugged into other systems by using the BANNER
      Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) interface.
      BANNER-CHEMDNER achieved an 85.68% and an 86.47% F-measure on the testing sets of
      CHEMDNER Chemical Entity Mention (CEM) and Chemical Document Indexing (CDI)
      subtasks, respectively, and achieved an 87.04% F-measure on the official testing 
      set of the BioCreative II gene mention task, showing remarkable performance in
      both chemical and biomedical NER. BANNER-CHEMDNER system is available at:

PG  - S6
LID - 10.1186/1758-2946-7-S1-S6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of robust methods for chemical named entity
      recognition, a challenging natural language processing task, was previously
      hindered by the lack of publicly available, large-scale, gold standard corpora.
      The recent public release of a large chemical entity-annotated corpus as a
      resource for the CHEMDNER track of the Fourth BioCreative Challenge Evaluation
      (BioCreative IV) workshop greatly alleviated this problem and allowed us to
      develop a conditional random fields-based chemical entity recogniser. In order to
      optimise its performance, we introduced customisations in various aspects of our 
      solution. These include the selection of specialised pre-processing analytics,
      the incorporation of chemistry knowledge-rich features in the training and
      application of the statistical model, and the addition of post-processing rules. 
      RESULTS: Our evaluation shows that optimal performance is obtained when our
      customisations are integrated into the chemical entity recogniser. When its
      performance is compared with that of state-of-the-art methods, under comparable
      experimental settings, our solution achieves competitive advantage. We also show 
      that our recogniser that uses a model trained on the CHEMDNER corpus is suitable 
      for recognising names in a wide range of corpora, consistently outperforming two 
      popular chemical NER tools. CONCLUSION: The contributions resulting from this
      work are two-fold. Firstly, we present the details of a chemical entity
      recognition methodology that has demonstrated performance at a competitive, if
      not superior, level as that of state-of-the-art methods. Secondly, the developed 
      suite of solutions has been made publicly available as a configurable workflow in
      the interoperable text mining workbench Argo. This allows interested users to
      conveniently apply and evaluate our solutions in the context of other chemical
      text mining tasks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to improve information access on chemical compounds and
      drugs (chemical entities) described in text repositories, it is very crucial to
      be able to identify chemical entity mentions (CEMs) automatically within text.
      The CHEMDNER challenge in BioCreative IV was specially designed to promote the
      implementation of corresponding systems that are able to detect mentions of
      chemical compounds and drugs, which has two subtasks: CDI (Chemical Document
      Indexing) and CEM. RESULTS: Our system processing pipeline consists of three
      major components: pre-processing (sentence detection, tokenization), recognition 
      (CRF-based approach), and post-processing (rule-based approach and format
      conversion). In our post-challenge system, the cost parameter in CRF model was
      optimized by 10-fold cross validation with grid search, and word representations 
      feature induced by Brown clustering method was introduced. For the CEM subtask,
      our official runs were ranked in top position by obtaining maximum 88.79%
      precision, 69.08% recall and 77.70% balanced F-measure, which were improved
      further to 88.43% precision, 76.48% recall and 82.02% balanced F-measure in our
      post-challenge system. CONCLUSIONS: In our system, instead of extracting a CEM as
      a whole, we regarded it as a sequence labeling problem. Though our current system
      has much room for improvement, our system is valuable in showing that the
      performance in term of balanced F-measure can be improved largely by utilizing
      large amounts of relatively inexpensive un-annotated PubMed abstracts and
      optimizing the cost parameter in CRF model. From our practice and lessons, if one
      directly utilizes some open-source natural language processing (NLP) toolkits,
      such as OpenNLP, Standford CoreNLP, false positive (FP) rate may be very high. It
      is better to develop some additional rules to minimize the FP rate if one does
      not want to re-train the related models. Our CEM recognition system is available 
      at: http://www.SciTeMiner.org/XuShuo/Demo/CEM.

AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) and text mining technologies for the chemical
      domain (ChemNLP or chemical text mining) are key to improve the access and
      integration of information from unstructured data such as patents or the
      scientific literature. Therefore, the BioCreative organizers posed the CHEMDNER
      (chemical compound and drug name recognition) community challenge, which promoted
      the development of novel, competitive and accessible chemical text mining
      systems. This task allowed a comparative assessment of the performance of various
      methodologies using a carefully prepared collection of manually labeled text
      prepared by specially trained chemists as Gold Standard data. We evaluated two
      important aspects: one covered the indexing of documents with chemicals (chemical
      document indexing - CDI task), and the other was concerned with finding the exact
      mentions of chemicals in text (chemical entity mention recognition - CEM task).
      27 teams (23 academic and 4 commercial, a total of 87 researchers) returned
      results for the CHEMDNER tasks: 26 teams for CEM and 23 for the CDI task. Top
      scoring teams obtained an F-score of 87.39% for the CEM task and 88.20% for the
      CDI task, a very promising result when compared to the agreement between human
      annotators (91%). The strategies used to detect chemicals included machine
      learning methods (e.g. conditional random fields) using a variety of features,
      chemistry and drug lexica, and domain-specific rules. We expect that the tools
      and resources resulting from this effort will have an impact in future
      developments of chemical text mining applications and will form the basis to find
      related chemical information for the detected entities, such as toxicological or 
      pharmacogenomic properties.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the incidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), defined as
      first-ever myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina (UA); evaluate recent
      temporal trends; and determine whether survival after ACS has changed over time
      and differs by type. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a population surveillance
      study conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota (population: 144,248). All persons
      hospitalized with incident ACS between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2010,
      were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
      codes, natural language processing of the medical records, and biomarkers.
      Myocardial infarction was validated by epidemiologic criteria and UA by the
      Braunwald classification. Patients were followed through June 30, 2013, for
      death. RESULTS: Of 1244 incident ACS cases, 35% (n=438) were UA and 65% (n=806)
      were MI. The standardized rates (per 100,000) of ACS were 284 (95% CI, 248-319)
      in 2005 and 184 (95% CI, 157-210) in 2010 (2010 vs 2005: rate ratio, 0.62; 95%
      CI, 0.53-0.73), indicating a 38% decline (similar for MI and UA). The 30-day case
      fatality rates did not differ by year of diagnosis but were worse for MI (8.9%;
      95% CI, 6.9%-10.9%) compared with UA (1.9%; 95% CI, 0.6%-3.1%). Among 30-day
      survivors, the risk of death did not differ by ACS type or diagnosis year.
      CONCLUSION: In the community, UA constitutes 35% of ACS. The incidence of ACS has
      declined in recent years, and trends were similar for UA and MI, reaffirming a
      substantial decline in all acute manifestations of coronary disease. Survival
      after ACS did not change over time, but 30-day survival was worse for MI compared
      with UA.

LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2015.02.010 [doi]
LID - S1532-0464(15)00043-X [pii]
AB  - In Electronic Health Records (EHRs), much of valuable information regarding
      patients' conditions is embedded in free text format. Natural language processing
      (NLP) techniques have been developed to extract clinical information from free
      text. One challenge faced in clinical NLP is that the meaning of clinical
      entities is heavily affected by modifiers such as negation. A negation detection 
      algorithm, NegEx, applies a simplistic approach that has been shown to be
      powerful in clinical NLP. However, due to the failure to consider the contextual 
      relationship between words within a sentence, NegEx fails to correctly capture
      the negation status of concepts in complex sentences. Incorrect negation
      assignment could cause inaccurate diagnosis of patients' condition or
      contaminated study cohorts. We developed a negation algorithm called DEEPEN to
      decrease NegEx's false positives by taking into account the dependency
      relationship between negation words and concepts within a sentence using Stanford
      dependency parser. The system was developed and tested using EHR data from
      Indiana University (IU) and it was further evaluated on Mayo Clinic dataset to
      assess its generalizability. The evaluation results demonstrate DEEPEN, which
      incorporates dependency parsing into NegEx, can reduce the number of incorrect
      negation assignment for patients with positive findings, and therefore improve
      the identification of patients with the target clinical findings in EHRs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to formulate an extended segment
      representation (SR) technique to enhance named entity recognition (NER) in
      medical applications. METHODS: An extension to the IOBES
      (Inside/Outside/Begin/End/Single) SR technique is formulated. In the proposed
      extension, a new class is assigned to words that do not belong to a named entity 
      (NE) in one context but appear as an NE in other contexts. Ambiguity in such
      cases can negatively affect the results of classification-based NER techniques.
      Assigning a separate class to words that can potentially cause ambiguity in NER
      allows a classifier to detect NEs more accurately; therefore increasing
      classification accuracy. RESULTS: The proposed SR technique is evaluated using
      the i2b2 2010 medical challenge data set with eight different classifiers. Each
      classifier is trained separately to extract three different medical NEs, namely
      treatment, problem, and test. From the three experimental results, the extended
      SR technique is able to improve the average F1-measure results pertaining to
      seven out of eight classifiers. The kNN classifier shows an average reduction of 
      0.18% across three experiments, while the C4.5 classifier records an average
      improvement of 9.33%.

TI  - Assessing the impact of case sensitivity and term information gain on biomedical 
      concept recognition.
PG  - e0119091
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0119091 [doi]
AB  - Concept recognition (CR) is a foundational task in the biomedical domain. It
      supports the important process of transforming unstructured resources into
      structured knowledge. To date, several CR approaches have been proposed, most of 
      which focus on a particular set of biomedical ontologies. Their underlying
      mechanisms vary from shallow natural language processing and dictionary lookup to
      specialized machine learning modules. However, no prior approach considers the
      case sensitivity characteristics and the term distribution of the underlying
      ontology on the CR process. This article proposes a framework that models the CR 
      process as an information retrieval task in which both case sensitivity and the
      information gain associated with tokens in lexical representations (e.g., term
      labels, synonyms) are central components of a strategy for generating term
      variants. The case sensitivity of a given ontology is assessed based on the
      distribution of so-called case sensitive tokens in its terms, while information
      gain is modelled using a combination of divergence from randomness and mutual
      information. An extensive evaluation has been carried out using the CRAFT corpus.
      Experimental results show that case sensitivity awareness leads to an increase of
      up to 0.07 F1 against a non-case sensitive baseline on the Protein Ontology and
      GO Cellular Component. Similarly, the use of information gain leads to an
      increase of up to 0.06 F1 against a standard baseline in the case of GO
      Biological Process and Molecular Function and GO Cellular Component. Overall,
      subject to the underlying token distribution, these methods lead to valid
      complementary strategies for augmenting term label sets to improve concept
      recognition.

TI  - Prediction of true test scores from observed item scores and ancillary data.
PG  - 363-85
LID - 10.1111/bmsp.12052 [doi]
AB  - In many educational tests which involve constructed responses, a traditional test
      score is obtained by adding together item scores obtained through holistic
      scoring by trained human raters. For example, this practice was used until 2008
      in the case of GRE((R)) General Analytical Writing and until 2009 in the case of 
      TOEFL((R)) iBT Writing. With use of natural language processing, it is possible
      to obtain additional information concerning item responses from computer programs
      such as e-rater((R)). In addition, available information relevant to examinee
      performance may include scores on related tests. We suggest application of
      standard results from classical test theory to the available data to obtain best 
      linear predictors of true traditional test scores. In performing such analysis,
      we require estimation of variances and covariances of measurement errors, a task 
      which can be quite difficult in the case of tests with limited numbers of items
      and with multiple measurements per item. As a consequence, a new estimation
      method is suggested based on samples of examinees who have taken an assessment
      more than once. Such samples are typically not random samples of the general
      population of examinees, so that we apply statistical adjustment methods to
      obtain the needed estimated variances and covariances of measurement errors. To
      examine practical implications of the suggested methods of analysis, applications
      are made to GRE General Analytical Writing and TOEFL iBT Writing. Results
      obtained indicate that substantial improvements are possible both in terms of
      reliability of scoring and in terms of assessment reliability.

TI  - The prevalence of problem opioid use in patients receiving chronic opioid
      therapy: computer-assisted review of electronic health record clinical notes.
PG  - 1208-14
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000145 [doi]
AB  - To estimate the prevalence of problem opioid use, we used natural language
      processing (NLP) techniques to identify clinical notes containing text indicating
      problem opioid use from over 8 million electronic health records (EHRs) of 22,142
      adult patients receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT) within Group Health clinics
      from 2006 to 2012. Computer-assisted manual review of NLP-identified clinical
      notes was then used to identify patients with problem opioid use (overuse,
      misuse, or abuse) according to the study criteria. These methods identified 9.4% 
      of patients receiving COT as having problem opioid use documented during the
      study period. An additional 4.1% of COT patients had an International
      Classification of Disease, version 9 (ICD-9) diagnosis without NLP-identified
      problem opioid use. Agreement between the NLP methods and ICD-9 coding was
      moderate (kappa = 0.61). Over one-third of the NLP-positive patients did not have
      an ICD-9 diagnostic code for opioid abuse or dependence. We used structured EHR
      data to identify 14 risk indicators for problem opioid use. Forty-seven percent
      of the COT patients had 3 or more risk indicators. The prevalence of problem
      opioid use was 9.6% among patients with 3 to 4 risk indicators, 26.6% among those
      with 5 to 6 risk indicators, and 55.04% among those with 7 or more risk
      indicators. Higher rates of problem opioid use were observed among young COT
      patients, patients who sustained opioid use for more than 4 quarters, and
      patients who received higher opioid doses. Methods used in this study provide a
      promising approach to efficiently identify clinically recognized problem opioid
      use documented in EHRs of large patient populations. Computer-assisted manual
      review of EHR clinical notes found a rate of problem opioid use of 9.4% among
      22,142 COT patients over 7 years.

      processing.
PG  - 543-52
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2015.51 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An accurate system for tracking of colonoscopy quality and
      surveillance intervals could improve the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
      colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and surveillance. The purpose of this study was
      to create and test such a system across multiple institutions utilizing natural
      language processing (NLP). METHODS: From 42,569 colonoscopies with pathology
      records from 13 centers, we randomly sampled 750 paired reports. We trained
      (n=250) and tested (n=500) an NLP-based program with 19 measurements that
      encompass colonoscopy quality measures and surveillance interval determination,
      using blinded, paired, annotated expert manual review as the reference standard. 
      The remaining 41,819 nonannotated documents were processed through the NLP system
      without manual review to assess performance consistency. The primary outcome was 
      system accuracy across the 19 measures. RESULTS: A total of 176 (23.5%) documents
      with 252 (1.8%) discrepant content points resulted from paired annotation. Error 
      rate within the 500 test documents was 31.2% for NLP and 25.4% for the paired
      annotators (P=0.001). At the content point level within the test set, the error
      rate was 3.5% for NLP and 1.9% for the paired annotators (P=0.04). When eight
      vaguely worded documents were removed, 125 of 492 (25.4%) were incorrect by NLP
      and 104 of 492 (21.1%) by the initial annotator (P=0.07). Rates of pathologic
      findings calculated from NLP were similar to those calculated by annotation for
      the majority of measurements. Test set accuracy was 99.6% for CRC, 95% for
      advanced adenoma, 94.6% for nonadvanced adenoma, 99.8% for advanced sessile
      serrated polyps, 99.2% for nonadvanced sessile serrated polyps, 96.8% for large
      hyperplastic polyps, and 96.0% for small hyperplastic polyps. Lesion location
      showed high accuracy (87.0-99.8%). Accuracy for number of adenomas was 92%.
      CONCLUSIONS: NLP can accurately report adenoma detection rate and the components 
      for determining guideline-adherent colonoscopy surveillance intervals across
      multiple sites that utilize different methods for reporting colonoscopy findings.

TI  - Visual Turing test for computer vision systems.
PG  - 3618-23
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1422953112 [doi]
AB  - Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy in detecting and
      localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated by the ability 
      of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a story about an
      image, we construct a "visual Turing test": an operator-assisted device that
      produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given test image. The
      query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides the correct answer
      or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes the next question
      ("just-in-time truthing"). The test is then administered to the computer-vision
      system, one question at a time. After the system's answer is recorded, the system
      is provided the correct answer and the next question. Parsing is trivial and
      deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural language processing.
      The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned from a training set, to
      produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers-the answer to a
      question, given the history of questions and their correct answers, is nearly
      equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test is only about 
      vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions that follow
      natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object, through an
      exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other uniquely
      instantiated objects.

TI  - Pharmacovigilance from social media: mining adverse drug reaction mentions using 
      sequence labeling with word embedding cluster features.
PG  - 671-81
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocu041 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social media is becoming increasingly popular as a platform for
      sharing personal health-related information. This information can be utilized for
      public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the use
      of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in social 
      media is highly informal, and user-expressed medical concepts are often
      nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited
      progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine
      learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to design
      a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media. METHODS: We introduce ADRMine, 
      a machine learning-based concept extraction system that uses conditional random
      fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of features, including a novel feature 
      for modeling words' semantic similarities. The similarities are modeled by
      clustering words based on unsupervised, pretrained word representation vectors
      (embeddings) generated from unlabeled user posts in social media using a deep
      learning technique. RESULTS: ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems 
      in the ADR extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82. Feature analysis
      demonstrates that the proposed word cluster features significantly improve
      extraction performance. CONCLUSION: It is possible to extract complex medical
      concepts, with relatively high performance, from informal, user-generated
      content. Our approach is particularly scalable, suitable for social media mining,
      as it relies on large volumes of unlabeled data, thus diminishing the need for
      large, annotated training data sets.

      origin: resource and text mining curation support.
LID - 10.1093/database/bav008 [doi]
LID - bav008 [pii]
AB  - Enzymes active on components of lignocellulosic biomass are used for industrial
      applications ranging from food processing to biofuels production. These include a
      diverse array of glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases, polysaccharide
      lyases and oxidoreductases. Fungi are prolific producers of these enzymes,
      spurring fungal genome sequencing efforts to identify and catalogue the genes
      that encode them. To facilitate the functional annotation of these genes,
      biochemical data on over 800 fungal lignocellulose-degrading enzymes have been
      collected from the literature and organized into the searchable database,
      mycoCLAP (http://mycoclap.fungalgenomics.ca). First implemented in 2011, and
      updated as described here, mycoCLAP is capable of ranking search results
      according to closest biochemically characterized homologues: this improves the
      quality of the annotation, and significantly decreases the time required to
      annotate novel sequences. The database is freely available to the scientific
      community, as are the open source applications based on natural language
      processing developed to support the manual curation of mycoCLAP. Database URL:

LID - S0010-4825(15)00062-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A wide gulf remains between knowledge and clinical practice. Clinical
      decision support has been demonstrated to be an effective knowledge tool that
      healthcare organizations can employ to deliver the "right knowledge to the right 
      people in the right form at the right time". How to adopt various clinical
      decision support (CDS) systems efficiently to facilitate evidence-based practice 
      is one challenge faced by knowledge translation research. METHOD: A
      computer-aided knowledge translation method that mobilizes evidence-based
      decision supports is proposed. The foundation of the method is a knowledge
      representation model that is able to cover, coordinate and synergize various
      types of medical knowledge to achieve centralized and effective knowledge
      management. Next, web-based knowledge-authoring and natural language processing
      based knowledge acquisition tools are designed to accelerate the transformation
      of the latest clinical evidence into computerized knowledge content. Finally, a
      batch of fundamental services, such as data acquisition and inference engine, are
      designed to actuate the acquired knowledge content. These services can be used as
      building blocks for various evidence-based decision support applications.
      RESULTS: Based on the above method, a computer-aided knowledge translation
      platform was constructed as a CDS infrastructure. Based on this platform, typical
      CDS applications were developed. A case study of drug use check demonstrates that
      the CDS intervention delivered by the platform has produced observable behavior
      changes (89.7% of alerted medical orders were revised by physicians). DISCUSSION:
      Computer-aided knowledge translation via a CDS infrastructure can be effective in
      facilitating knowledge translation in clinical settings.

AB  - RNA secondary structure prediction is a key technology in RNA bioinformatics.
      Most algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction use probabilistic models, 
      in which the model parameters are trained with reliable RNA secondary structures.
      Because of the difficulty of determining RNA secondary structures by experimental
      procedures, such as NMR or X-ray crystal structural analyses, there are still
      many RNA sequences that could be useful for training whose secondary structures
      have not been experimentally determined. In this paper, we introduce a novel
      semi-supervised learning approach for training parameters in a probabilistic
      model of RNA secondary structures in which we employ not only RNA sequences with 
      annotated secondary structures but also ones with unknown secondary structures.
      Our model is based on a hybrid of generative (stochastic context-free grammars)
      and discriminative models (conditional random fields) that has been successfully 
      applied to natural language processing. Computational experiments indicate that
      the accuracy of secondary structure prediction is improved by incorporating RNA
      sequences with unknown secondary structures into training. To our knowledge, this
      is the first study of a semi-supervised learning approach for RNA secondary
      structure prediction. This technique will be useful when the number of reliable
      structures is limited.

      notes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bodyweight related measures (weight, height, BMI, abdominal
      circumference) are extremely important for clinical care, research and quality
      improvement. These and other vitals signs data are frequently missing from
      structured tables of electronic health records. However they are often recorded
      as text within clinical notes. In this project we sought to develop and validate 
      a learning algorithm that would extract bodyweight related measures from clinical
      notes in the Veterans Administration (VA) Electronic Health Record to complement 
      the structured data used in clinical research. METHODS: We developed the Regular 
      Expression Discovery Extractor (REDEx), a supervised learning algorithm that
      generates regular expressions from a training set. The regular expressions
      generated by REDEx were then used to extract the numerical values of interest. To
      train the algorithm we created a corpus of 268 outpatient primary care notes that
      were annotated by two annotators. This annotation served to develop the
      annotation process and identify terms associated with bodyweight related measures
      for training the supervised learning algorithm. Snippets from an additional 300
      outpatient primary care notes were subsequently annotated independently by two
      reviewers to complete the training set. Inter-annotator agreement was calculated.
      REDEx was applied to a separate test set of 3561 notes to generate a dataset of
      weights extracted from text. We estimated the number of unique individuals who
      would otherwise not have bodyweight related measures recorded in the CDW and the 
      number of additional bodyweight related measures that would be additionally
      captured. RESULTS: REDEx's performance was: accuracy=98.3%, precision=98.8%,
      recall=98.3%, F=98.5%. In the dataset of weights from 3561 notes, 7.7% of notes
      contained bodyweight related measures that were not available as structured data.
      In addition 2 additional bodyweight related measures were identified per
      individual per year. CONCLUSION: Bodyweight related measures are frequently
      stored as text in clinical notes. A supervised learning algorithm can be used to 
      extract this data. Implications for clinical care, epidemiology, and quality
      improvement efforts are discussed.

TI  - A Semi-Infinite Programming based algorithm for determining T-optimum designs for
      model discrimination.
PG  - 11-24
AB  - T-optimum designs for model discrimination are notoriously difficult to find
      because of the computational difficulty involved in solving an optimization
      problem that involves two layers of optimization. Only a handful of analytical
      T-optimal designs are available for the simplest problems; the rest in the
      literature are found using specialized numerical procedures for a specific
      problem. We propose a potentially more systematic and general way for finding
      T-optimal designs using a Semi-Infinite Programming (SIP) approach. The strategy 
      requires that we first reformulate the original minimax or maximin optimization
      problem into an equivalent semi-infinite program and solve it using an
      exchange-based method where lower and upper bounds produced by solving the outer 
      and the inner programs, are iterated to convergence. A global Nonlinear
      Programming (NLP) solver is used to handle the subproblems, thus finding the
      optimal design and the least favorable parametric configuration that minimizes
      the residual sum of squares from the alternative or test models. We also use a
      nonlinear program to check the global optimality of the SIP-generated design and 
      automate the construction of globally optimal designs. The algorithm is
      successfully used to produce results that coincide with several T-optimal designs
      reported in the literature for various types of model discrimination problems
      with normally distributed errors. However, our method is more general, merely
      requiring that the parameters of the model be estimated by a numerical
      optimization.

TI  - Generation of broadband noise-like pulse from Yb-doped fiber laser ring cavity.
PG  - 804-7
LID - 10.1364/OL.40.000804 [doi]
AB  - We have demonstrated a generation of the noise-like pulse (NLP) with broadband
      spectrum in a nonlinear polarized evolution-based passive mode-locked Yb-doped
      fiber (YDF) ring laser. At the cavity dispersion of near zero, the NLP with
      spectrum bandwidth up to 131 nm (FWHM) was obtained at a central wavelength of
      1070 nm with output power of 136 mW and 80 MHz repetition rate. To our best
      knowledge, this spectrum bandwidth of NLP is the broadest among the reported YDF 
      lasers. The autocorrelation function of pulse contained the short (30 fs) and
      long (4.6 ps) components. This short coherence light source is well suited for
      the optical coherent tomography used for ophthalmology at a wavelength of
      approximately 1000 nm.

AB  - AIM: To complete the data of ocular trauma in central China, as a well-known
      tertiary referral center for ocular trauma, we documented the epidemiological
      characteristics and visual outcomes of patients hospitalized for ocular trauma in
      this region. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients hospitalized for ocular
      trauma in central China from 2006 to 2011 was performed. RESULTS: This study
      included 5964 eyes of 5799 patients. The average age was 35.5+/-21.8y with a
      male-to-female ratio of 2.8:1. The most common age was 45-59y age group. Most
      patients were farmers and workers (51.9%). The most common injuries were firework
      related (24.5%), road traffic related (24.2%), and work related (15.0%). Among
      the most common causative agents were firecrackers (24.5%), followed by
      metal/knife/scissors (21.4%). Most injuries occurred in January (14.2%), February
      (27.0%), and August (10.0%). There were 8.5% patients with ocular injuries
      combined with other injuries. The incidence of open ocular injuries (4585 eyes,
      76.9%) was higher than closed ocular injuries (939 eyes, 15.7%). The incidences
      of chemical and thermal ocular injuries were 1.2% and 0.6%. Ocular trauma score
      (OTS) predicted final visual acuity at non light perception (NLP), 20/200-20/50
      and 20/40 with a sensitivity of 100%, and light perception (LP)/hand motion (HM) 
      and 1/200-19/200 with a specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides
      recent epidemiological data of patients hospitalized for ocular trauma in central
      China. Some factors influencing the visual outcome include time interval between 
      injury and visit to the clinic, wound location, open or closed globe injury,
      initial visual acuity, and OTS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate determination of protein complexes is crucial for
      understanding cellular organization and function. High-throughput experimental
      techniques have generated a large amount of protein-protein interaction (PPI)
      data, allowing prediction of protein complexes from PPI networks. However, the
      high-throughput data often includes false positives and false negatives, making
      accurate prediction of protein complexes difficult. METHOD: The biomedical
      literature contains large quantities of PPI data that, along with high-throughput
      experimental PPI data, are valuable for protein complex prediction. In this
      study, we employ a natural language processing technique to extract PPI data from
      the biomedical literature. This data is subsequently integrated with
      high-throughput PPI and gene ontology data by constructing attributed PPI
      networks, and a novel method for predicting protein complexes from the attributed
      PPI networks is proposed. This method allows calculation of the relative
      contribution of high-throughput and biomedical literature PPI data. RESULTS: Many
      well-characterized protein complexes are accurately predicted by this method when
      apply to two different yeast PPI datasets. The results show that (i) biomedical
      literature PPI data can effectively improve the performance of protein complex
      prediction; (ii) our method makes good use of high-throughput and biomedical
      literature PPI data along with gene ontology data to achieve state-of-the-art
      protein complex prediction capabilities.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To study eyes with no light perception (NLP) occurring 
      secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Records of consecutive patients with neovascular AMD seen during a
      10-year period were reviewed to ascertain which patients had NLP due to
      neovascular AMD. RESULTS: Ten of 1,150 patients (0.9%) with neovascular AMD had
      NLP in one eye (study eye) from neovascular AMD. All 10 patients had bilateral
      neovascular AMD. Each study eye had a large macular disciform scar and 360
      degrees peripapillary subretinal fibrovascular tissue. Seven of nine (78%) study 
      eyes had optic disc pallor, versus none of eight fellow eyes (P = .04). Mean
      fellow eye vision was 20/231, ranging from 20/50 to NLP (P = .006 vs study eyes).
      No seeing fellow eye had choroidal neovascularization encircling the optic disc
      (P = .0004). CONCLUSION: NLP from neovascular AMD is associated with 360 degrees 
      peripapillary subretinal fibrosis. This fibrosis may cause chronic ischemic optic
      neuropathy contributing to extinguished vision.

TI  - Challenges and practical approaches with word sense disambiguation of acronyms
      and abbreviations in the clinical domain.
PG  - 35-42
LID - 10.4258/hir.2015.21.1.35 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although acronyms and abbreviations in clinical text are used widely 
      on a daily basis, relatively little research has focused upon word sense
      disambiguation (WSD) of acronyms and abbreviations in the healthcare domain.
      Since clinical notes have distinctive characteristics, it is unclear whether
      techniques effective for acronym and abbreviation WSD from biomedical literature 
      are sufficient. METHODS: The authors discuss feature selection for automated
      techniques and challenges with WSD of acronyms and abbreviations in the clinical 
      domain. RESULTS: There are significant challenges associated with the informal
      nature of clinical text, such as typographical errors and incomplete sentences;
      difficulty with insufficient clinical resources, such as clinical sense
      inventories; and obstacles with privacy and security for conducting research with
      clinical text. Although we anticipated that using sophisticated techniques, such 
      as biomedical terminologies, semantic types, part-of-speech, and language
      modeling, would be needed for feature selection with automated machine learning
      approaches, we found instead that simple techniques, such as bag-of-words, were
      quite effective in many cases. Factors, such as majority sense prevalence and the
      degree of separateness between sense meanings, were also important
      considerations. CONCLUSIONS: The first lesson is that a comprehensive
      understanding of the unique characteristics of clinical text is important for
      automatic acronym and abbreviation WSD. The second lesson learned is that
      investigators may find that using simple approaches is an effective starting
      point for these tasks. Finally, similar to other WSD tasks, an understanding of
      baseline majority sense rates and separateness between senses is important.
      Further studies and practical solutions are needed to better address these
      issues.

TI  - Effect of Evidence-based Clinical Decision Support on the Use and Yield of CT
      Pulmonary Angiographic Imaging in Hospitalized Patients.
PG  - 167-74
LID - 10.1148/radiol.15141208 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of clinical decision support (CDS) on the use
      and yield of inpatient computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography for acute 
      pulmonary embolism (PE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant,
      institutional review board-approved study with waiver of informed consent
      included all adults admitted to a 793-bed teaching hospital from April 1, 2007,
      to June 30, 2012. The CDS intervention, implemented after a baseline observation 
      period, informed providers who placed an order for CT pulmonary angiographic
      imaging about the pretest probability of the study based on a validated decision 
      rule. Use of CT pulmonary angiographic and admission data from administrative
      databases was obtained for this study. By using a validated natural language
      processing algorithm on radiology reports, each CT pulmonary angiographic
      examination was classified as positive or negative for acute PE. Primary outcome 
      measure was monthly use of CT pulmonary angiography per 1000 admissions.
      Secondary outcome was CT pulmonary angiography yield (percentage of CT pulmonary 
      angiographic examinations that were positive for acute PE). Linear trend analysis
      was used to assess for effect and trend differences in use and yield of CT
      pulmonary angiographic imaging before and after CDS. RESULTS: In 272 374
      admissions over the study period, 5287 patients underwent 5892 CT pulmonary
      angiographic examinations. A 12.3% decrease in monthly use of CT pulmonary
      angiography (26.0 to 22.8 CT pulmonary angiographic examinations per 1000
      admissions before and after CDS, respectively; P = .008) observed 1 month after
      CDS implementation was sustained over the ensuing 32-month period. There was a
      nonsignificant 16.3% increase in monthly yield of CT pulmonary angiography or
      percentage of CT pulmonary angiographic examinations positive for acute PE after 
      CDS (P = .65). CONCLUSION: Implementation of evidence-based CDS for inpatients
      was associated with a 12.3% immediate and sustained decrease in use of CT
      pulmonary angiographic examinations in the evaluation of inpatients for acute PE.

AB  - Current scanning access methods for text generation in AAC devices are limited to
      relatively few options, most notably row/column variations within a matrix. We
      present Huffman scanning, a new method for applying statistical language models
      to binary-switch, static-grid typing AAC interfaces, and compare it to other
      scanning options under a variety of conditions. We present results for 16 adults 
      without disabilities and one 36-year-old man with locked-in syndrome who presents
      with complex communication needs and uses AAC scanning devices for writing.
      Huffman scanning with a statistical language model yielded significant typing
      speedups for the 16 participants without disabilities versus any of the other
      methods tested, including two row/column scanning methods. A similar pattern of
      results was found with the individual with locked-in syndrome. Interestingly,
      faster typing speeds were obtained with Huffman scanning using a more leisurely
      scan rate than relatively fast individually calibrated scan rates. Overall, the
      results reported here demonstrate great promise for the usability of Huffman
      scanning as a faster alternative to row/column scanning.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) effects on the
      tissues using the quantification of inflammatory mediators, and to assess their
      impact on the development of postoperative complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Prospective observational non-randomized study on 40 patients underwent to PCNL. 
      50 patients with kidney stone who were treated by extracorporeal shock wave
      lithotripsy (ESWL) were used as control group. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta),
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive
      protein (CRP) were determined at baseline (T0: before treatment), and at 2, 6 and
      24hours after (T1, T2 and T3). RESULTS: No relevant changes on IL-1beta and
      TNF-alpha were found. IL-6 showed two peaks at 2 and 6hours post-PCNL (median
      17.8 and 15.8 pg/mL, respectively). At 24hours CRP had reached its peak value
      (3.4mg/L). The group treated with ESWL no showed significant changes in any of
      the markers. The serum concentration of IL-6 and CRP at 24hours post-NLP is
      different depending on the occurrence of complications (P=.001 and P=.039,
      respectively). IL-6 showed a good predictive power for the development of
      complications (AUC .801). CONCLUSIONS: Tissue damage caused by the PCNL is low.
      This damage increases significantly in those cases showing postoperative
      complications. IL-6 at 24hours has been shown to be a good predictive tool for
      the development of complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limitations to using administrative data to identify
      postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE). We used a novel approach to quantify 
      postoperative VTE events among Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) surgical
      patients during 2005-2010. METHODS: We used VA administrative data to exclude
      patients with VTE during 12 months prior to surgery. We identified probable
      postoperative VTE events within 30 and 90 days post-surgery in three settings: 1)
      pre-discharge inpatient, using a VTE diagnosis code and a pharmacy record for
      anticoagulation; 2) post-discharge inpatient, using a VTE diagnosis code followed
      by a pharmacy record for anticoagulation within 7 days; and 3) outpatient, using 
      a VTE diagnosis code and either anticoagulation or a therapeutic procedure code
      with natural language processing (NLP) to confirm acute VTE in clinical notes.
      RESULTS: Among 468,515 surgeries without prior VTE, probable VTEs were documented
      within 30 and 90 days in 3,931 (0.8%) and 5,904 (1.3%), respectively. Of probable
      VTEs within 30 or 90 days post-surgery, 47.8% and 62.9%, respectively, were
      diagnosed post-discharge. Among post-discharge VTE diagnoses, 86% resulted in a
      VA hospital readmission. Fewer than 25% of outpatient records with both VTE
      diagnoses and anticoagulation prescriptions were confirmed by NLP as acute VTE
      events. CONCLUSION: More than half of postoperative VTE events were diagnosed
      post-discharge; analyses of surgical discharge records are inadequate to identify
      postoperative VTE. The NLP results demonstrate that the combination of VTE
      diagnoses and anticoagulation prescriptions in outpatient administrative records 
      cannot be used to validly identify postoperative VTE events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Full syntactic parsing of clinical text as a part of clinical natural
      language processing (NLP) is critical for a wide range of applications. Several
      robust syntactic parsers are publicly available to produce linguistic
      representations for sentences. However, these existing parsers are mostly trained
      on general English text and may require adaptation for optimal performance on
      clinical text. Our objective was to adapt an existing general English parser for 
      the clinical text of operative reports via lexicon augmentation, statistics
      adjusting, and grammar rules modification based on operative reports. METHOD: The
      Stanford unlexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parser lexicon
      was expanded with SPECIALIST lexicon along with statistics collected from a
      limited set of operative notes tagged by two POS taggers (GENIA tagger and
      MedPost). The most frequently occurring verb entries of the SPECIALIST lexicon
      were adjusted based on manual review of verb usage in operative notes. Stanford
      parser grammar production rules were also modified based on linguistic features
      of operative reports. An analogous approach was then applied to the GENIA corpus 
      to test the generalizability of this approach to biologic text. RESULTS: The new 
      unlexicalized PCFG parser extended with the extra lexicon from SPECIALIST along
      with accurate statistics collected from an operative note corpus tagged with
      GENIA POS tagger improved the F-score by 2.26% from 87.64% to 89.90%. There was a
      progressive improvement with the addition of multiple approaches. Lexicon
      augmentation combined with statistics from the operative notes corpus provided
      the greatest improvement of parser performance. Application of this approach on
      the GENIA corpus increased the F-score by 3.81% with a simple new grammar and
      addition of the GENIA corpus lexicon. CONCLUSION: Using statistics collected from
      clinical text tagged with POS taggers along with proper modification of grammars 
      and lexicons of an unlexicalized PCFG parser may improve parsing performance of
      existing parsers on specialized clinical text.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Structured data on mammographic findings are difficult to obtain
      without manual review. We developed and evaluated a rule-based natural language
      processing (NLP) system to extract mammographic findings from free-text
      mammography reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The NLP system extracted four
      mammographic findings: mass, calcification, asymmetry, and architectural
      distortion, using a dictionary look-up method on 93,705 mammography reports from 
      Group Health. Status annotations and anatomical location annotation were
      associated to each NLP detected finding through association rules. After
      excluding negated, uncertain, and historical findings, affirmative mentions of
      detected findings were summarized. Confidence flags were developed to denote
      reports with highly confident NLP results and reports with possible NLP errors. A
      random sample of 100 reports was manually abstracted to evaluate the accuracy of 
      the system. RESULTS: The NLP system correctly coded 96-99 out of our sample of
      100 reports depending on findings. Measures of sensitivity, specificity and
      negative predictive values exceeded 0.92 for all findings. Positive predictive
      values were relatively low for some findings due to their low prevalence.
      DISCUSSION: Our NLP system was implemented entirely in SAS Base, which makes it
      portable and easy to implement. It performed reasonably well with multiple
      applications, such as using confidence flags as a filter to improve the
      efficiency of manual review. Refinements of library and association rules, and
      testing on more diverse samples may further improve its performance. CONCLUSION: 
      Our NLP system successfully extracts clinically useful information from
      mammography reports. Moreover, SAS is a feasible platform for implementing NLP
      algorithms.

AB  - Nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs), also known as nanodiscs, are lipid bilayers
      bounded by apolipoprotein. Lipids and membrane proteins cannot exchange between
      NLPs. However, the addition of bicelles opens NLPs and transfers their contents
      to bicelles, which freely exchange lipids and proteins. NLP-bicelle interactions 
      may provide a new method for studying membrane protein oligomerization. The
      interaction mechanism was investigated by stopped flow fluorometry. NLPs with
      lipids having fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) donors and acceptors 
      were mixed with a 200-fold molar excess of dihexanoyl phosphatidylcholine
      (DHPC)/dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bicelles, and the rate of lipid
      transfer was monitored by the disappearance of FRET. Near or below the DMPC phase
      transition temperature, the kinetics were sigmoidal. Free DHPC and apolipoprotein
      were ruled out as participants in autocatalytic mechanisms. The NLP-bicelle
      mixing rate showed a strong temperature dependence (activation energy = 28
      kcal/mol). Models are proposed for the NLP-bicelle mixing, including one
      involving fusion pores.

TI  - Automated confidence ranked classification of randomized controlled trial
      articles: an aid to evidence-based medicine.
PG  - 707-17
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocu025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: For many literature review tasks, including systematic review (SR) and
      other aspects of evidence-based medicine, it is important to know whether an
      article describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Current manual annotation 
      is not complete or flexible enough for the SR process. In this work, highly
      accurate machine learning predictive models were built that include confidence
      predictions of whether an article is an RCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LibSVM
      classifier was used with forward selection of potential feature sets on a large
      human-related subset of MEDLINE to create a classification model requiring only
      the citation, abstract, and MeSH terms for each article. RESULTS: The model
      achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.973 and
      mean squared error of 0.013 on the held out year 2011 data. Accurate confidence
      estimates were confirmed on a manually reviewed set of test articles. A second
      model not requiring MeSH terms was also created, and performs almost as well.
      DISCUSSION: Both models accurately rank and predict article RCT confidence. Using
      the model and the manually reviewed samples, it is estimated that about 8000 (3%)
      additional RCTs can be identified in MEDLINE, and that 5% of articles tagged as
      RCTs in Medline may not be identified. CONCLUSION: Retagging human-related
      studies with a continuously valued RCT confidence is potentially more useful for 
      article ranking and review than a simple yes/no prediction. The automated RCT
      tagging tool should offer significant savings of time and effort during the
      process of writing SRs, and is a key component of a multistep text mining
      pipeline that we are building to streamline SR workflow. In addition, the model
      may be useful for identifying errors in MEDLINE publication types. The RCT
      confidence predictions described here have been made available to users as a web 
      service with a user query form front end at:

AB  - In recent years the amount of experimental data that is produced in biomedical
      research and the number of papers that are being published in this field have
      grown rapidly. In order to keep up to date with developments in their field of
      interest and to interpret the outcome of experiments in light of all available
      literature, researchers turn more and more to the use of automated literature
      mining. As a consequence, text mining tools have evolved considerably in number
      and quality and nowadays can be used to address a variety of research questions
      ranging from de novo drug target discovery to enhanced biological interpretation 
      of the results from high throughput experiments. In this paper we introduce the
      most important techniques that are used for a text mining and give an overview of
      the text mining tools that are currently being used and the type of problems they
      are typically applied for.

LID - S1526-5900(15)00049-8 [pii]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Identification of patients at increased risk for problem opioid use
      is recommended by chronic opioid therapy (COT) guidelines, but clinical
      assessment of risks often does not occur on a timely basis. This research
      assessed whether structured electronic health record (EHR) data could accurately 
      predict subsequent problem opioid use. This research was conducted among 2,752
      chronic noncancer pain patients initiating COT (>/=70 days' supply of an opioid
      in a calendar quarter) during 2008 to 2010. Patients were followed through the
      end of 2012 or until disenrollment from the health plan, whichever was earlier.
      Baseline risk indicators were derived from structured EHR data for a 2-year
      period prior to COT initiation. Problem opioid use after COT initiation was
      assessed by reviewing clinician-documented problem opioid use in EHR clinical
      notes identified using natural language processing techniques followed by
      computer-assisted manual review of natural language processing-positive clinical 
      notes. Multivariate analyses in learning and validation samples assessed
      prediction of subsequent problem opioid use. The area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (c-statistic) for problem opioid use was .739 (95%
      confidence interval = .688, .790) in the validation sample. A measure of problem 
      opioid use derived from a simple weighted count of risk indicators was found to
      be comparably predictive of the natural language processing measure of problem
      opioid use, with 60% sensitivity and 72% specificity for a weighted count of >/=4
      risk indicators. PERSPECTIVE: An automated surveillance method utilizing baseline
      risk indicators from structured EHR data was moderately accurate in identifying
      COT patients who had subsequent problem opioid use.

TI  - Deep neural nets as a method for quantitative structure-activity relationships.
PG  - 263-74
LID - 10.1021/ci500747n [doi]
AB  - Neural networks were widely used for quantitative structure-activity
      relationships (QSAR) in the 1990s. Because of various practical issues (e.g.,
      slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they
      were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and
      random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has
      witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks
      to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms,
      and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs),
      i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in
      many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here 
      we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a 
      set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Merck's drug discovery
      effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but 
      our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data
      sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance
      than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is
      demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although
      training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing
      units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.

AB  - Changes in some lexical features of language have been associated with the onset 
      and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Here we describe a method to extract key 
      features from discourse transcripts, which we evaluated on non-scripted news
      conferences from President Ronald Reagan, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's
      disease in 1994, and President George Herbert Walker Bush, who has no known
      diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Key word counts previously associated with
      cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease were extracted and regression analyses
      were conducted. President Reagan showed a significant reduction in the number of 
      unique words over time and a significant increase in conversational fillers and
      non-specific nouns over time. There was no significant trend in these features
      for President Bush.

TI  - Synthesis and characterization of Her2-NLP peptide conjugates targeting

      microscopic imaging.
PG  - 113-7
LID - 10.1007/s10895-014-1486-9 [doi]
AB  - To synthesize a fluorescent Her2-NLP peptide conjugate consisting of Her2/neu
      targeting peptide and nuclear localization sequence peptide (NLP) and assess its 
      cellular uptake and intracellular localization for radionuclide cancer therapy
      targeting Her2/neu-positive circulating breast cancer cells (CBCC). Fluorescent
      Cy5.5 Her2-NLP peptide conjugate was synthesized by coupling a bivalent peptide
      sequence, which consisted of a Her2-binding peptide (NH2-GSGKCCYSL) and an NLP
      peptide (CGYGPKKKRKVGG) linked by a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain with 6
      repeating units, with an activated Cy5.5 ester. The conjugate was separated and
      purified by HPLC and then characterized by Maldi-MS. The intracellular
      localization of fluorescent Cy5.5 Her2-NLP peptide conjugate was assessed by
      fluorescent microscopic imaging using a confocal microscope after incubation of
      Cy5.5-Her2-NLP with Her2/neu positive breast cancer cells and Her2/neu negative
      control breast cancer cells, respectively. Fluorescent signals were detected in
      cytoplasm of Her2/neu positive breast cancer cells (SKBR-3 and BT474 cell lines),
      but not or little in cytoplasm of Her2/neu negative breast cancer cells
      (MDA-MB-231), after incubation of the breast cancer cells with Cy5.5-Her2-NLP
      conjugates in vitro. No fluorescent signals were detected within the nuclei of
      Her2/neu positive SKBR-3 and BT474 breast cancer cells, neither Her2/neu negative
      MDA-MB-231 cells, incubated with the Cy5.5-Her2-NLP peptide conjugates,
      suggesting poor nuclear localization of the Cy5.5-Her2-NLP conjugates localized
      within the cytoplasm after their cellular uptake and internalization by the
      Her2/neu positive breast cancer cells. Her2-binding peptide (KCCYSL) is a
      promising agent for radionuclide therapy of Her2/neu positive breast cancer using
      a beta(-) or alpha emitting radionuclide, but poor nuclear localization of the
      Her2-NLP peptide conjugates may limit its use for eradication of
      Her2/neu-positive CBCC using I-125 or other Auger electron emitting radionuclide.

TI  - OntoMate: a text-mining tool aiding curation at the Rat Genome Database.
LID - 10.1093/database/bau129 [doi]
LID - bau129 [pii]
AB  - The Rat Genome Database (RGD) is the premier repository of rat genomic, genetic
      and physiologic data. Converting data from free text in the scientific literature
      to a structured format is one of the main tasks of all model organism databases. 
      RGD spends considerable effort manually curating gene, Quantitative Trait Locus
      (QTL) and strain information. The rapidly growing volume of biomedical literature
      and the active research in the biological natural language processing (bioNLP)
      community have given RGD the impetus to adopt text-mining tools to improve
      curation efficiency. Recently, RGD has initiated a project to use OntoMate, an
      ontology-driven, concept-based literature search engine developed at RGD, as a
      replacement for the PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) search engine in 
      the gene curation workflow. OntoMate tags abstracts with gene names, gene
      mutations, organism name and most of the 16 ontologies/vocabularies used at RGD. 
      All terms/ entities tagged to an abstract are listed with the abstract in the
      search results. All listed terms are linked both to data entry boxes and a term
      browser in the curation tool. OntoMate also provides user-activated filters for
      species, date and other parameters relevant to the literature search. Using the
      system for literature search and import has streamlined the process compared to
      using PubMed. The system was built with a scalable and open architecture,
      including features specifically designed to accelerate the RGD gene curation
      process. With the use of bioNLP tools, RGD has added more automation to its
      curation workflow. Database URL: http://rgd.mcw.edu.

TI  - Extracting Various Classes of Data From Biological Text Using the Concept of
      Existence Dependency.
PG  - 1918-28
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2015.2392786 [doi]
AB  - One of the key goals of biological natural language processing (NLP) is the
      automatic information extraction from biomedical publications. Most current
      constituency and dependency parsers overlook the semantic relationships between
      the constituents comprising a sentence and may not be well suited for capturing
      complex long-distance dependences. We propose in this paper a hybrid
      constituency-dependency parser for biological NLP information extraction called
      EDCC. EDCC aims at enhancing the state of the art of biological text mining by
      applying novel linguistic computational techniques that overcome the limitations 
      of current constituency and dependency parsers outlined earlier, as follows: 1)
      it determines the semantic relationship between each pair of constituents in a
      sentence using novel semantic rules; and 2) it applies a semantic relationship
      extraction model that extracts information from different structural forms of
      constituents in sentences. EDCC can be used to extract different types of data
      from biological texts for purposes such as protein function prediction, genetic
      network construction, and protein-protein interaction detection. We evaluated the
      quality of EDCC by comparing it experimentally with six systems. Results showed
      marked improvement.

AB  - A wide variety of cells are generated by the expression of characteristic sets of
      genes, primarily those regulated by cell-specific transcription. To elucidate the
      mechanism regulating cell-specific gene expression in a highly specialized cell, 
      AFD thermosensory neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans, we analyzed the promoter
      sequences of guanylyl cyclase genes, gcy-8 and gcy-18, exclusively expressed in
      AFD. In this study, we showed that AFD-specific expression of gcy-8 and gcy-18
      requires the co-expression of homeodomain proteins, CEH-14/LHX3 and TTX-1/OTX1.
      We observed that mutation of ttx-1 or ceh-14 caused a reduction in the expression
      of gcy-8 and gcy-18 and that the expression was completely lost in double
      mutants. This synergy effect was also observed with other AFD marker genes, such 
      as ntc-1, nlp-21and cng-3. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed direct 
      interaction of CEH-14 and TTX-1 proteins with gcy-8 and gcy-18 promoters in
      vitro. The binding sites of CEH-14 and TTX-1 proteins were confirmed to be
      essential for AFD-specific expression of gcy-8 and gcy-18 in vivo. We also
      demonstrated that forced expression of CEH-14 and TTX-1 in AWB chemosensory
      neurons induced ectopic expression of gcy-8 and gcy-18 reporters in this neuron. 
      Finally, we showed that the regulation of gcy-8 and gcy-18 expression by ceh-14
      and ttx-1 is evolutionally conserved in five Caenorhabditis species. Taken
      together, ceh-14 and ttx-1 expression determines the fate of AFD as terminal
      selector genes at the final step of cell specification.

AB  - A neuropeptide (NLP-12) and its receptor (CKR-2) potentiate tonic and evoked ACh 
      release at Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions. Increased evoked
      release is mediated by a presynaptic pathway (egl-30 Galphaq and egl-8 PLCbeta)
      that produces DAG, and by DAG binding to short and long UNC-13 proteins.
      Potentiation of tonic ACh release persists in mutants deficient for egl-30
      Galphaq and egl-8 PLCbeta and requires DAG binding to UNC-13L (but not UNC-13S). 
      Thus, NLP-12 adjusts tonic and evoked release by distinct mechanisms.

TI  - Generation of silver standard concept annotations from biomedical texts with
      special relevance to phenotypes.
PG  - e0116040
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0116040 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health records and scientific articles possess differing linguistic
      characteristics that may impact the performance of natural language processing
      tools developed for one or the other. In this paper, we investigate the
      performance of four extant concept recognition tools: the clinical Text Analysis 
      and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES), the National Center for Biomedical
      Ontology (NCBO) Annotator, the Biomedical Concept Annotation System (BeCAS) and
      MetaMap. Each of the four concept recognition systems is applied to four
      different corpora: the i2b2 corpus of clinical documents, a PubMed corpus of
      Medline abstracts, a clinical trails corpus and the ShARe/CLEF corpus. In
      addition, we assess the individual system performances with respect to one gold
      standard annotation set, available for the ShARe/CLEF corpus. Furthermore, we
      built a silver standard annotation set from the individual systems' output and
      assess the quality as well as the contribution of individual systems to the
      quality of the silver standard. Our results demonstrate that mainly the NCBO
      annotator and cTAKES contribute to the silver standard corpora (F1-measures in
      the range of 21% to 74%) and their quality (best F1-measure of 33%), independent 
      from the type of text investigated. While BeCAS and MetaMap can contribute to the
      precision of silver standard annotations (precision of up to 42%), the F1-measure
      drops when combined with NCBO Annotator and cTAKES due to a low recall. In
      conclusion, the performances of individual systems need to be improved
      independently from the text types, and the leveraging strategies to best take
      advantage of individual systems' annotations need to be revised. The textual
      content of the PubMed corpus, accession numbers for the clinical trials corpus,
      and assigned annotations of the four concept recognition systems as well as the
      generated silver standard annotation sets are available from
      http://purl.org/phenotype/resources. The textual content of the ShARe/CLEF
      (https://sites.google.com/site/shareclefehealth/data) and i2b2
      (https://i2b2.org/NLP/DataSets/) corpora needs to be requested with the
      individual corpus providers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nail lichen planus (NLP) occurs in 10% of patients with disseminated 
      disease but it can also occur in isolation. The outcome of treatment is usually
      disappointing and data about its long-term prognosis are lacking. STUDY AIM: To
      study clinical features, response to treatment and follow-up of a series of 20
      patients with NLP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted of 20 
      patients with histologically confirmed NLP seen at consultations for nail
      disorders between September 2009 and April 2013. RESULTS: The mean age was 35
      years (9-56 years) with no gender preponderance. Forty percent of patients were
      children. Stress was an evident triggering factor in 20% of patients. The mean
      duration was around 48 months (2 months to 10 years). Only 25% of patients had
      extra-ungual lesions. All 20 nails were affected in 55% of patients. Nail matrix 
      involvement was observed in 85% of cases and 55% had nail-bed involvement.
      Twenty-five percent of patients were presenting severe involvement such as
      pterygium or anonychia. Intramuscular corticosteroids were given to 10 patients. 
      In 80% of patients, the NLP was limited or regressed rapidly from the third
      injection. The average follow-up was 24 months. DISCUSSION: Our study highlights 
      the frequency of paediatric forms and of often aesthetically unacceptable nail
      scarring. Early diagnosis of NLP, notably in children, would allow initiation of 
      adequate treatment that could perhaps limit the risk of such sequelae.

TI  - Systems pharmacology of mifepristone (RU486) reveals its 47 hub targets and
      network: comprehensive analysis and pharmacological focus on FAK-Src-Paxillin
      complex.
PG  - 7830

AB  - Mifepristone (RU486), a synthetic steroid compound used as an abortifacient drug,
      has received considerable attention to its anticancer activity recently. To
      explore the possibility of using mifepristone as a cancer metastasis
      chemopreventive, we performed a systems pharmacology analysis of
      mifepristone-related molecules in the present study. Data were collected by using
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 513 mifepristone-related genes were dug out
      and classified functionally using a gene ontology (GO) hierarchy, followed by
      KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Potential signal pathways and targets involved 
      in cancer were obtained by integrative network analysis. Total thirty-three
      proteins were involved in focal adhesion-the key signaling pathway associated
      with cancer metastasis. Molecular and cellular assays further demonstrated that
      mifepristone had the ability to prevent breast cancer cells from migration and
      interfere with their adhesion to endothelial cells. Moreover, mifepristone
      inhibited the expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and the
      formation of FAK/Src/Paxillin complex, which are correlated with cell adhesion
      and migration. This study set a good example to identify chemotherapeutic
      potential seamlessly from systems pharmacology to cellular pharmacology, and the 
      revealed hub genes may be the promising targets for cancer metastasis
      chemoprevention.

TI  - Biomedical question answering using semantic relations.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/s12859-014-0365-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The proliferation of the scientific literature in the field of
      biomedicine makes it difficult to keep abreast of current knowledge, even for
      domain experts. While general Web search engines and specialized information
      retrieval (IR) systems have made important strides in recent decades, the problem
      of accurate knowledge extraction from the biomedical literature is far from
      solved. Classical IR systems usually return a list of documents that have to be
      read by the user to extract relevant information. This tedious and time-consuming
      work can be lessened with automatic Question Answering (QA) systems, which aim to
      provide users with direct and precise answers to their questions. In this work we
      propose a novel methodology for QA based on semantic relations extracted from the
      biomedical literature. RESULTS: We extracted semantic relations with the SemRep
      natural language processing system from 122,421,765 sentences, which came from
      21,014,382 MEDLINE citations (i.e., the complete MEDLINE distribution up to the
      end of 2012). A total of 58,879,300 semantic relation instances were extracted
      and organized in a relational database. The QA process is implemented as a search
      in this database, which is accessed through a Web-based application, called SemBT
      (available at http://sembt.mf.uni-lj.si ). We conducted an extensive evaluation
      of the proposed methodology in order to estimate the accuracy of extracting a
      particular semantic relation from a particular sentence. Evaluation was performed
      by 80 domain experts. In total 7,510 semantic relation instances belonging to
      2,675 distinct relations were evaluated 12,083 times. The instances were
      evaluated as correct 8,228 times (68%). CONCLUSIONS: In this work we propose an
      innovative methodology for biomedical QA. The system is implemented as a
      Web-based application that is able to provide precise answers to a wide range of 
      questions. A typical question is answered within a few seconds. The tool has some
      extensions that make it especially useful for interpretation of DNA microarray
      results.

TI  - Microtask crowdsourcing for disease mention annotation in PubMed abstracts.
PG  - 282-93
AB  - Identifying concepts and relationships in biomedical text enables knowledge to be
      applied in computational analyses. Many biological natural language processing
      (BioNLP) projects attempt to address this challenge, but the state of the art
      still leaves much room for improvement. Progress in BioNLP research depends on
      large, annotated corpora for evaluating information extraction systems and
      training machine learning models. Traditionally, such corpora are created by
      small numbers of expert annotators often working over extended periods of time.
      Recent studies have shown that workers on microtask crowdsourcing platforms such 
      as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) can, in aggregate, generate high-quality
      annotations of biomedical text. Here, we investigated the use of the AMT in
      capturing disease mentions in PubMed abstracts. We used the NCBI Disease corpus
      as a gold standard for refining and benchmarking our crowdsourcing protocol.
      After several iterations, we arrived at a protocol that reproduced the
      annotations of the 593 documents in the 'training set' of this gold standard with
      an overall F measure of 0.872 (precision 0.862, recall 0.883). The output can
      also be tuned to optimize for precision (max = 0.984 when recall = 0.269) or
      recall (max = 0.980 when precision = 0.436). Each document was completed by 15
      workers, and their annotations were merged based on a simple voting method. In
      total 145 workers combined to complete all 593 documents in the span of 9 days at
      a cost of $.066 per abstract per worker. The quality of the annotations, as
      judged with the F measure, increases with the number of workers assigned to each 
      task; however minimal performance gains were observed beyond 8 workers per task. 
      These results add further evidence that microtask crowdsourcing can be a valuable
      tool for generating well-annotated corpora in BioNLP. Data produced for this
      analysis are available at

TI  - Characteristics of drug combination therapy in oncology by analyzing clinical
      trial data on ClinicalTrials.gov.
PG  - 68-79
AB  - Within the past few decades, drug combination therapy has been intensively
      studied in oncology and other complex disease areas, especially during the early 
      drug discovery stage, as drug combinations have the potential to improve
      treatment response, minimize development of resistance or minimize adverse
      events. In the present, designing combination trials relies mainly on clinical
      and empirical experience. While empirical experience has indeed crafted
      efficacious combination therapy clinical trials (combination trials), however,
      garnering experience with patients can take a lifetime. The preliminary step to
      eliminating this barrier of time, then, is to understand the current state of
      combination trials. Thus, we present the first large-scale study of clinical
      trials (2008-2013) from ClinicalTrials.gov to compare combination trials to
      non-combination trials, with a focus on oncology. In this work, we developed a
      classifier to identify combination trials and oncology trials through natural
      language processing techniques. After clustering trials, we categorized them
      based on selected characteristics and observed trends present. Among the
      characteristics studied were primary purpose, funding source, endpoint
      measurement, allocation, and trial phase. We observe a higher prevalence of
      combination therapy in oncology (25.6% use combination trials) in comparison to
      other disease trials (6.9%). However, surprisingly the prevalence of combinations
      does not increase over the years. In addition, the trials supported by the NIH
      are significantly more likely to use combinations of drugs than those supported
      by industry. Our preliminary study of current combination trials may facilitate
      future trial design and move more preclinical combination studies to the clinical
      trial stage.

TI  - Predicting Non-Adherence with Outpatient Colonoscopy Using a Novel Electronic
      Tool that Measures Prior Non-Adherence.
PG  - 724-31
LID - 10.1007/s11606-014-3165-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurately predicting the risk of no-show for a scheduled colonoscopy
      can help target interventions to improve compliance with colonoscopy, and thereby
      reduce the disease burden of colorectal cancer and enhance the utilization of
      resources within endoscopy units. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to utilize information
      available in an electronic medical record (EMR) and endoscopy scheduling system
      to create a predictive model for no-show risk, and to simultaneously evaluate the
      role for natural language processing (NLP) in developing such a model. DESIGN:
      This was a retrospective observational study using discovery and validation
      phases to design a colonoscopy non-adherence prediction model. An NLP-derived
      variable called the Non-Adherence Ratio ("NAR") was developed, validated, and
      included in the model. PARTICIPANTS: Patients scheduled for outpatient
      colonoscopy at an Academic Medical Center (AMC) that is part of a multi-hospital 
      health system, 2009 to 2011, were included in the study. MAIN MEASURES: Odds
      ratios for non-adherence were calculated for all variables in the discovery
      cohort, and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) was calculated for
      the final non-adherence prediction model. KEY RESULTS: The non-adherence model
      included six variables: 1) gender; 2) history of psychiatric illness, 3) NAR; 4) 
      wait time in months; 5) number of prior missed endoscopies; and 6) education
      level. The model achieved discrimination in the validation cohort (AUC= =70.2 %).
      At a threshold non-adherence score of 0.46, the model's sensitivity and
      specificity were 33 % and 92 %, respectively. Removing the NAR from the model
      significantly reduced its predictive power (AUC = 64.3 %, difference = 5.9 %, p <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A six-variable model using readily available clinical and
      demographic information demonstrated accuracy for predicting colonoscopy
      non-adherence. The NAR, a novel variable developed using NLP technology,
      significantly strengthened this model's predictive power.

TI  - Monitoring suicidal patients in primary care using electronic health records.
PG  - 65-71
LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2015.01.140181 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients at risk for suicide often come into contact with primary
      care providers, many of whom use electronic health records (EHRs) for charting.
      It is not known, however, how often suicide ideation or attempts are documented
      in EHRs. METHODS: We used retrospective analyses of de-identified EHR data from a
      distributed health network of primary care organizations to estimate the
      frequency of using diagnostic codes to record suicidal ideation and attempts.
      Data came from 3 sources: a clinician notes field processed using natural
      language processing; a suicidal ideation item on a patient-reported depression
      severity instrument (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]); and diagnostic
      codes from the EHR. RESULTS: Only 3% of patients with an indication of suicidal
      ideation in the notes field had a corresponding International Classification of
      Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), code (kappa = 0.036). Agreement between an
      indication of suicidal ideation from item 9 of the PHQ-9 and an ICD-9 code was
      slightly higher (kappa = 0.068). Suicide attempt indicated in the notes field was
      more likely to be recorded using an ICD-9 code (19%; kappa = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Few cases of suicidal ideation and attempt were documented in patients' EHRs
      using diagnostic codes. Increased documentation of suicidal ideation and
      behaviors in patients' EHRs may improve their monitoring in the health care
      system.

TI  - Accuracy of using automated methods for detecting adverse events from electronic 
      health record data: a research protocol.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/s13012-014-0197-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse events are associated with significant morbidity, mortality
      and cost in hospitalized patients. Measuring adverse events is necessary for
      quality improvement, but current detection methods are inaccurate, untimely and
      expensive. The advent of electronic health records and the development of
      automated methods for encoding and classifying electronic narrative data, such as
      natural language processing, offer an opportunity to identify potentially better 
      methods. The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of using
      automated methods for detecting three highly prevalent adverse events: a)
      hospital-acquired pneumonia, b) catheter-associated bloodstream infections, and
      c) in-hospital falls. METHODS/DESIGN: This validation study will be conducted at 
      two large Canadian academic health centres: the McGill University Health Centre
      (MUHC) and The Ottawa Hospital (TOH). The study population consists of all
      medical, surgical and intensive care unit patients admitted to these centres
      between 2008 and 2014. An automated detection algorithm will be developed and
      validated for each of the three adverse events using electronic data extracted
      from multiple clinical databases. A random sample of MUHC patients will be used
      to develop the automated detection algorithms (cohort 1, development set). The
      accuracy of these algorithms will be assessed using chart review as the reference
      standard. Then, receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to identify
      optimal cut points for each of the data sources. Multivariate logistic regression
      and the areas under curve (AUC) will be used to identify the optimal combination 
      of data sources that maximize the accuracy of adverse event detection. The most
      accurate algorithms will then be validated on a second random sample of MUHC
      patients (cohort 1, validation set), and accuracy will be measured using chart
      review as the reference standard. The most accurate algorithms validated at the
      MUHC will then be applied to TOH data (cohort 2), and their accuracy will be
      assessed using a reference standard assessment of the medical chart. DISCUSSION: 
      There is a need for more accurate, timely and efficient measures of adverse
      events in acute care hospitals. This is a critical requirement for evaluating the
      effectiveness of preventive interventions and for tracking progress in patient
      safety through time.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder where affected individuals
      develop benign or malignant nervous system tumors. To date, NF1 is caused by
      mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome band 17q11.2. In
      this study, we aimed to characterize novel recurrent regional chromosomal
      imbalances and tumor-related candidate genes in NF1-associated cutaneous
      neurofibromas. Nine cutaneous neurofibromas from NF1 patients were screened for
      recurrent chromosomal imbalances using high-resolution 400K oligonucleotide array
      comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). All the cases exhibited at least one
      sub-microscopic abnormality. Regions of recurrent chromosomal imbalances in a
      least one third of cases were loss of 1q13.2 (33%, FAM19A3), 1q21.1 (44%,
      RABGAP1L), 2q37.1 (56%, INPP5D), 3p25.1 (67%, CHCHD4), 4p15.32 (56%, FGFBP1),
      5q11.2 (56%, ARL15), 6q22.31 (56%, NKAIN2), 6q22.33 (67%, ARHGAP18), 6q25.1 (67%,
      UST), 7q13 (56%, ADCY1), 12q13.13 (44%, KRT71), 19q13.32 (56%, GRLF1), and
      20p11.21 (56%, NLP) and gain of 2p23.3 (76%, C2orf53), 8q22.3 (44%, ODF1) and
      8q24.3 (67%, ARC). Several chromosomal imbalances, including loss of 7q11.23,
      13q14.1, 14q32.13, 17p12, and 17q11.2 were detected at a lower frequency. We also
      confirmed that these chromosomal imbalances were not detected in the
      patient-matched lymphocyte DNAs. Amongst the 6 tumor-related candidate genes
      (RABGAP1L, ADCY1, SLIT2, GRLF1, UST, and ARC) identified in the regions of
      recurrent chromosomal imbalances, the gene expression changes of UST
      (down-regulation) and ARC (up-regulation) were found to be significantly
      associated with copy number alterations. The novel recurrent chromosomal
      imbalances and the altered expression levels of the tumor-related candidate genes
      may be associated with the development of NF1-associated benign cutaneous
      neurofibromas.

TI  - Evaluation of an Automated Information Extraction Tool for Imaging Data Elements 
      to Populate a Breast Cancer Screening Registry.
PG  - 567-75
LID - 10.1007/s10278-014-9762-4 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer screening is central to early breast cancer detection. Identifying 
      and monitoring process measures for screening is a focus of the National Cancer
      Institute's Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized
      Regimens (PROSPR) initiative, which requires participating centers to report
      structured data across the cancer screening continuum. We evaluate the accuracy
      of automated information extraction of imaging findings from radiology reports,
      which are available as unstructured text. We present prevalence estimates of
      imaging findings for breast imaging received by women who obtained care in a
      primary care network participating in PROSPR (n = 139,953 radiology reports) and 
      compared automatically extracted data elements to a "gold standard" based on
      manual review for a validation sample of 941 randomly selected radiology reports,
      including mammograms, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). The prevalence of imaging findings vary by data element 
      and modality (e.g., suspicious calcification noted in 2.6% of screening
      mammograms, 12.1% of diagnostic mammograms, and 9.4% of tomosynthesis exams). In 
      the validation sample, the accuracy of identifying imaging findings, including
      suspicious calcifications, masses, and architectural distortion (on mammogram and
      tomosynthesis); masses, cysts, non-mass enhancement, and enhancing foci (on MRI);
      and masses and cysts (on ultrasound), range from 0.8 to1.0 for recall, precision,
      and F-measure. Information extraction tools can be used for accurate
      documentation of imaging findings as structured data elements from text reports
      for a variety of breast imaging modalities. These data can be used to populate
      screening registries to help elucidate more effective breast cancer screening
      processes.

PG  - 7-15
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2015.30.1.7 [doi]
AB  - De-identification of personal health information is essential in order not to
      require written patient informed consent. Previous de-identification methods were
      proposed using natural language processing technology in order to remove the
      identifiers in clinical narrative text, although these methods only focused on
      narrative text written in English. In this study, we propose a regular
      expression-based de-identification method used to address bilingual clinical
      records written in Korean and English. To develop and validate regular expression
      rules, we obtained training and validation datasets composed of 6,039 clinical
      notes of 20 types and 5,000 notes of 33 types, respectively. Fifteen regular
      expression rules were constructed using the development dataset and those rules
      achieved 99.87% precision and 96.25% recall for the validation dataset. Our
      de-identification method successfully removed the identifiers in diverse types of
      bilingual clinical narrative texts. This method will thus assist physicians to
      more easily perform retrospective research.

TI  - Social in, social out: How the brain responds to social language with more social
      language.
PG  - 31-63
AB  - Social connection is a fundamental human need. As such, people's brains are
      sensitized to social cues, such as those carried by language, and to promoting
      social communication. The neural mechanisms of certain key building blocks in
      this process, such as receptivity to and reproduction of social language,
      however, are not known. We combined quantitative linguistic analysis and
      neuroimaging to connect neural activity in brain regions used to simulate the
      mental states of others with exposure to, and re-transmission of, social
      language. Our results link findings on successful idea transmission from
      communication science, sociolinguistics and cognitive neuroscience to
      prospectively predict the degree of social language that participants utilize
      when re-transmitting ideas as a function of 1) initial language inputs and 2)
      neural activity during idea exposure.

TI  - Automated analysis of free speech predicts psychosis onset in high-risk youths.
PG  - 15030
LID - 10.1038/npjschz.2015.30 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Psychiatry lacks the objective clinical tests routinely
      used in other specializations. Novel computerized methods to characterize complex
      behaviors such as speech could be used to identify and predict psychiatric
      illness in individuals. AIMS: In this proof-of-principle study, our aim was to
      test automated speech analyses combined with Machine Learning to predict later
      psychosis onset in youths at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. METHODS:
      Thirty-four CHR youths (11 females) had baseline interviews and were assessed
      quarterly for up to 2.5 years; five transitioned to psychosis. Using automated
      analysis, transcripts of interviews were evaluated for semantic and syntactic
      features predicting later psychosis onset. Speech features were fed into a convex
      hull classification algorithm with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to
      assess their predictive value for psychosis outcome. The canonical correlation
      between the speech features and prodromal symptom ratings was computed. RESULTS: 
      Derived speech features included a Latent Semantic Analysis measure of semantic
      coherence and two syntactic markers of speech complexity: maximum phrase length
      and use of determiners (e.g., which). These speech features predicted later
      psychosis development with 100% accuracy, outperforming classification from
      clinical interviews. Speech features were significantly correlated with prodromal
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the utility of automated speech analysis 
      to measure subtle, clinically relevant mental state changes in emergent
      psychosis. Recent developments in computer science, including natural language
      processing, could provide the foundation for future development of objective
      clinical tests for psychiatry.

TI  - An RLP23-SOBIR1-BAK1 complex mediates NLP-triggered immunity.
PG  - 15140
LID - 10.1038/nplants.2015.140 [doi]
AB  - Plants and animals employ innate immune systems to cope with microbial infection.
      Pattern-triggered immunity relies on the recognition of microbe-derived patterns 
      by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide
      1-like proteins (NLPs) constitute plant immunogenic patterns that are unique, as 
      these proteins are produced by multiple prokaryotic (bacterial) and eukaryotic
      (fungal, oomycete) species. Here we show that the leucine-rich repeat receptor
      protein (LRR-RP) RLP23 binds in vivo to a conserved 20-amino-acid fragment found 
      in most NLPs (nlp20), thereby mediating immune activation in Arabidopsis
      thaliana. RLP23 forms a constitutive, ligand-independent complex with the LRR
      receptor kinase (LRR-RK) SOBIR1 (Suppressor of Brassinosteroid insensitive 1
      (BRI1)-associated kinase (BAK1)-interacting receptor kinase 1), and recruits a
      second LRR-RK, BAK1, into a tripartite complex upon ligand binding. Stable,
      ectopic expression of RLP23 in potato (Solanum tuberosum) confers nlp20 pattern
      recognition and enhanced immunity to destructive oomycete and fungal plant
      pathogens, such as Phytophthora infestans and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. PRRs that
      recognize widespread microbial patterns might be particularly suited for
      engineering immunity in crop plants.

TI  - Performance and carcass characteristics of guinea fowl fed on dietary Neem
      (Azadirachta indica) leaf powder as a growth promoter.
PG  - 78-82
AB  - The present work aimed at studying growth pattern and carcass traits in pearl
      grey guinea fowl fed on dietary Neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf powder (NLP) over 
      a period of 12 weeks. Day old guinea fowl keets (n=120) were randomly assigned to
      four treatment groups, each with 3 replicates. The first treatment was designated
      as control (T0) in which no supplement was added to the feed, while in treatments
      T1, T2 and T3, NLP was provided as 1, 2 and 3 g per kg of feed, respectively. The
      results revealed a significant increase in body weight at 12 weeks; 1229.7 for
      T1, 1249.8 for T2, and 1266.2 g T3 compared to 1220.0 g for the control group
      (P<0.05). The results also showed that the supplementation of NLP significantly
      increased feed intake (P</=0.05) which might be due to the hypoglycaemic activity
      of Neem. A significant increase was also found in the feed conversion ratio (FCR)
      of the treated groups over the control, showing that feeding NLP to the treated
      groups has lowered their residual feed efficiency. The results of the study
      demonstrate the beneficial effects of supplementing NLP on body weight gain and
      dressed yield in the treated groups in guinea fowl. NLP is, therefore, suggested 
      to be used as a feed supplement in guinea fowl for higher profitability.

TI  - Automated Extraction of Substance Use Information from Clinical Texts.
PG  - 2121-30
AB  - Within clinical discourse, social history (SH) includes important information
      about substance use (alcohol, drug, and nicotine use) as key risk factors for
      disease, disability, and mortality. In this study, we developed and evaluated a
      natural language processing (NLP) system for automated detection of substance use
      statements and extraction of substance use attributes (e.g., temporal and status)
      based on Stanford Typed Dependencies. The developed NLP system leveraged
      linguistic resources and domain knowledge from a multi-site social history study,
      Propbank and the MiPACQ corpus. The system attained F-scores of 89.8, 84.6 and
      89.4 respectively for alcohol, drug, and nicotine use statement detection, as
      well as average F-scores of 82.1, 90.3, 80.8, 88.7, 96.6, and 74.5 respectively
      for extraction of attributes. Our results suggest that NLP systems can achieve
      good performance when augmented with linguistic resources and domain knowledge
      when applied to a wide breadth of substance use free text clinical notes.

AB  - Mental health problems are an independent predictor of increased healthcare
      utilization. We created random forest classifiers for predicting two outcomes
      following a patient's first behavioral health encounter: decreased utilization by
      any amount (AUROC 0.74) and ultra-high absolute utilization (AUROC 0.88). These
      models may be used for clinical decision support by referring providers, to
      automatically detect patients who may benefit from referral, for cost management,
      or for risk/protection factor analysis.

TI  - Automated Classification of Consumer Health Information Needs in Patient Portal
      Messages.
PG  - 1861-70
AB  - Patients have diverse health information needs, and secure messaging through
      patient portals is an emerging means by which such needs are expressed and met.
      As patient portal adoption increases, growing volumes of secure messages may
      burden healthcare providers. Automated classification could expedite portal
      message triage and answering. We created four automated classifiers based on word
      content and natural language processing techniques to identify health information
      needs in 1000 patient-generated portal messages. Logistic regression and random
      forest classifiers detected single information needs well, with area under the
      curves of 0.804-0.914. A logistic regression classifier accurately found the set 
      of needs within a message, with a Jaccard index of 0.859 (95% Confidence
      Interval: (0.847, 0.871)). Automated classification of consumer health
      information needs expressed in patient portal messages is feasible and may allow 
      direct linking to relevant resources or creation of institutional resources for
      commonly expressed needs.

TI  - A Study of Neural Word Embeddings for Named Entity Recognition in Clinical Text.
PG  - 1326-33
AB  - Clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task for extracting
      important patient information from clinical text to support clinical and
      translational research. This study explored the neural word embeddings derived
      from a large unlabeled clinical corpus for clinical NER. We systematically
      compared two neural word embedding algorithms and three different strategies for 
      deriving distributed word representations. Two neural word embeddings were
      derived from the unlabeled Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive
      Care (MIMIC) II corpus (403,871 notes). The results from both 2010 i2b2 and 2014 
      Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) data showed that the binarized word embedding
      features outperformed other strategies for deriving distributed word
      representations. The binarized embedding features improved the F1-score of the
      Conditional Random Fields based clinical NER system by 2.3% on i2b2 data and 2.4%
      on SemEval data. The combined feature from the binarized embeddings and the Brown
      clusters improved the F1-score of the clinical NER system by 2.9% on i2b2 data
      and 2.7% on SemEval data. Our study also showed that the distributed word
      embedding features derived from a large unlabeled corpus can be better than the
      widely used Brown clusters. Further analysis found that the neural word
      embeddings captured a wide range of semantic relations, which could be
      discretized into distributed word representations to benefit the clinical NER
      system. The low-cost distributed feature representation can be adapted to any
      other clinical natural language processing research.

      Notes.
PG  - 1252-9
AB  - Accurate temporal identification and normalization is imperative for many
      biomedical and clinical tasks such as generating timelines and identifying
      phenotypes. A major natural language processing challenge is developing and
      evaluating a generalizable temporal modeling approach that performs well across
      corpora and institutions. Our long-term goal is to create such a model. We
      initiate our work on reaching this goal by focusing on temporal expression
      (TIMEX3) identification. We present a systematic approach to 1) generalize
      existing solutions for automated TIMEX3 span detection, and 2) assess
      similarities and differences by various instantiations of TIMEX3 models applied
      on separate clinical corpora. When evaluated on the 2012 i2b2 and the 2015
      Clinical TempEval challenge corpora, our conclusion is that our approach is
      successful - we achieve competitive results for automated classification, and we 
      identify similarities and differences in TIMEX3 modeling that will be informative
      in the development of a simplified, general temporal model.

TI  - Recognizing Disjoint Clinical Concepts in Clinical Text Using Machine
      Learning-based Methods.
PG  - 1184-93
AB  - Clinical concept recognition (CCR) is a fundamental task in clinical natural
      language processing (NLP) field. Almost all current machine learning-based CCR
      systems can only recognize clinical concepts of consecutive words (called
      consecutive clinical concepts, CCCs), but can do nothing about clinical concepts 
      of disjoint words (called disjoint clinical concepts, DCCs), which widely exist
      in clinical text. In this paper, we proposed two novel types of representations
      for disjoint clinical concepts, and applied two state-of-the-art machine learning
      methods to recognizing consecutive and disjoint concepts. Experiments conducted
      on the 2013 ShARe/CLEF challenge corpus showed that our best system achieved a
      "strict" F-measure of 0.803 for CCCs, a "strict" F-measure of 0.477 for DCCs, and
      a "strict" F-measure of 0.783 for all clinical concepts, significantly higher
      than the baseline systems by 4.2% and 4.1% respectively.

TI  - Automatic Extraction and Post-coordination of Spatial Relations in Consumer
      Language.
PG  - 1083-92
AB  - To incorporate ontological concepts in natural language processing (NLP) it is
      often necessary to combine simple concepts into complex concepts
      (post-coordination). This is especially true in consumer language, where a more
      limited vocabulary forces consumers to utilize highly productive language that is
      almost impossible to pre-coordinate in an ontology. Our work focuses on
      recognizing an important case for post-coordination in natural language: spatial 
      relations between disorders and anatomical structures. Consumers typically
      utilize such spatial relations when describing symptoms. We describe an annotated
      corpus of 2,000 sentences with 1,300 spatial relations, and a second corpus of
      500 of these relations manually normalized to UMLS concepts. We use machine
      learning techniques to recognize these relations, obtaining good performance.
      Further, we experiment with methods to normalize the relations to an existing
      ontology. This two-step process is analogous to the combination of concept
      recognition and normalization, and achieves comparable results.

TI  - Assessing the Utility of Automatic Cancer Registry Notifications Data Extraction 
      from Free-Text Pathology Reports.
PG  - 953-62
AB  - Cancer Registries record cancer data by reading and interpreting pathology cancer
      specimen reports. For some Registries this can be a manual process, which is
      labour and time intensive and subject to errors. A system for automatic
      extraction of cancer data from HL7 electronic free-text pathology reports has
      been proposed to improve the workflow efficiency of the Cancer Registry. The
      system is currently processing an incoming trickle feed of HL7 electronic
      pathology reports from across the state of Queensland in Australia to produce an 
      electronic cancer notification. Natural language processing and symbolic
      reasoning using SNOMED CT were adopted in the system; Queensland Cancer Registry 
      business rules were also incorporated. A set of 220 unseen pathology reports
      selected from patients with a range of cancers was used to evaluate the
      performance of the system. The system achieved overall recall of 0.78, precision 
      of 0.83 and F-measure of 0.80 over seven categories, namely, basis of diagnosis
      (3 classes), primary site (66 classes), laterality (5 classes), histological type
      (94 classes), histological grade (7 classes), metastasis site (19 classes) and
      metastatic status (2 classes). These results are encouraging given the large
      cross-section of cancers. The system allows for the provision of clinical coding 
      support as well as indicative statistics on the current state of cancer, which is
      not otherwise available.

TI  - Knowledge Extraction from MEDLINE by Combining Clustering with Natural Language
      Processing.
PG  - 915-24
AB  - The identification of relevant predicates between co-occurring concepts in
      scientific literature databases like MEDLINE is crucial for using these sources
      for knowledge extraction, in order to obtain meaningful biomedical predications
      as subject-predicate-object triples. We consider the manually assigned MeSH
      indexing terms (main headings and subheadings) in MEDLINE records as a rich
      resource for extracting a broad range of domain knowledge. In this paper, we
      explore the combination of a clustering method for co-occurring concepts based on
      their related MeSH subheadings in MEDLINE with the use of SemRep, a natural
      language processing engine, which extracts predications from free text documents.
      As a result, we generated sets of clusters of co-occurring concepts and
      identified the most significant predicates for each cluster. The association of
      such predicates with the co-occurrences of the resulting clusters produces the
      list of predications, which were checked for relevance.

TI  - Initial Readability Assessment of Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria.
PG  - 687-96
AB  - Various search engines are available to clinical trial seekers. However, it
      remains unknown how comprehensible clinical trial eligibility criteria used for
      recruitment are to a lay audience. This study initially investigated this
      problem. Readability of eligibility criteria was assessed according to (i)
      shallow and lexical characteristics through the use of an established, generic
      readability metric; (ii) syntactic characteristics through natural language
      processing techniques; and (iii) health terminological characteristics through an
      automated comparison to technical and lay health texts. We further stratified
      clinical trials according to various study characteristics (e.g., source country 
      or study type) to understand potential factors influencing readability. Mainly
      caused by frequent use of technical jargons, a college reading level was found to
      be necessary to understand eligibility criteria text, a level much higher than
      the average literacy level of the general American population. The use of
      technical jargons should be minimized to simplify eligibility criteria text.

TI  - Reviewing 741 patients records in two hours with FASTVISU.
PG  - 553-9
AB  - The secondary use of electronic health records opens up new perspectives. They
      provide researchers with structured data and unstructured data, including free
      text reports. Many applications been developed to leverage knowledge from
      free-text reports, but manual review of documents is still a complex process. We 
      developed FASTVISU a web-based application to assist clinicians in reviewing
      documents. We used FASTVISU to review a set of 6340 documents from 741 patients
      suffering from the celiac disease. A first automated selection pruned the
      original set to 847 documents from 276 patients' records. The records were
      reviewed by two trained physicians to identify the presence of 15 auto-immune
      diseases. It took respectively two hours and two hours and a half to evaluate the
      entire corpus. Inter-annotator agreement was high (Cohen's kappa at 0.89).
      FASTVISU is a user-friendly modular solution to validate entities extracted by
      NLP methods from free-text documents stored in clinical data warehouses.

TI  - POETenceph - Automatic identification of clinical notes indicating encephalopathy
      using a realist ontology.
PG  - 512-21
AB  - Identifying inpatients with encephalopathy is important. The disorder is
      prevalent, often missed, and puts patients at risk. We describe POETenceph,
      natural language processing pipeline, which ranks clinical notes on the extent to
      which they indicate the patient had encephalopathy. We use a realist ontology of 
      the entities and relationships indicative of encephalopathy in clinical notes.
      POETenceph includes a passage rank algorithm, which takes identified disorders;
      matches them to the ontology; calculates the diffuseness, centrality, and length 
      of the matched entry; adds the scores; and returns the ranked documents. We
      evaluate it against a corpus of clinical documents annotated for evidence of
      delirium. Higher POETenceph are associated with increasing numbers of reviewer
      annotations. Detailed examination found that 65% of the bottom scoring documents 
      contained little or no evidence and 70% of the top contained good evidence.
      POETenceph can effectively rank clinical documents for their evidence of
      encephalopathy as characterized by delirium.

TI  - Chalcogen bonds in complexes of SOXY (X, Y = F, Cl) with nitrogen bases.
PG  - 535-41
LID - 10.1021/jp511828h [doi]
AB  - SOF2, SOFCl, and SOCl2 were each paired with a series of N bases. The potential
      energy surface of the binary complexes were characterized by MP2 calculations
      with double and triple-xi basis sets, extrapolated to complete sets. The most
      stable configurations contained a S...N chalcogen bond with interaction energies 
      as high as 6.8 kcal/mol. These structures are stabilized by a Nlp --> sigma*(S-Z)
      electron transfer (Z = O, F, Cl), complemented by Coulombic attraction of N to
      the sigma-hole opposite the Z atom. N...S-F and N...S-Cl chalcogen bonds are
      stronger than N...S horizontal lineO interactions. Formation of each chalcogen
      bond elongates all of the internal covalent bonds within SOXY, especially the
      S-Cl bond. Halogen-bonded (N...Cl-S) complexes were also observed, but these are 
      more weakly bound, by less than 3 kcal/mol.

TI  - Automated pancreatic cyst screening using natural language processing: a new tool
      in the early detection of pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 447-53
LID - 10.1111/hpb.12375 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: As many as 3% of computed tomography (CT) scans detect pancreatic
      cysts. Because pancreatic cysts are incidental, ubiquitous and poorly understood,
      follow-up is often not performed. Pancreatic cysts may have a significant
      malignant potential and their identification represents a 'window of opportunity'
      for the early detection of pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study was to
      implement an automated Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based pancreatic cyst
      identification system. METHOD: A multidisciplinary team was assembled. NLP-based 
      identification algorithms were developed based on key words commonly used by
      physicians to describe pancreatic cysts and programmed for automated search of
      electronic medical records. A pilot study was conducted prospectively in a single
      institution. RESULTS: From March to September 2013, 566,233 reports belonging to 
      50,669 patients were analysed. The mean number of patients reported with a
      pancreatic cyst was 88/month (range 78-98). The mean sensitivity and specificity 
      were 99.9% and 98.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: NLP is an effective tool to
      automatically identify patients with pancreatic cysts based on electronic medical
      records (EMR). This highly accurate system can help capture patients 'at-risk' of
      pancreatic cancer in a registry.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This article explores how measures of semantic similarity and
      relatedness are impacted by the semantic groups to which the concepts they are
      measuring belong. Our goal is to determine if there are distinctions between
      homogeneous comparisons (where both concepts belong to the same group) and
      heterogeneous ones (where the concepts are in different groups). Our hypothesis
      is that the similarity measures will be significantly affected since they rely on
      hierarchical is-a relations, whereas relatedness measures should be less impacted
      since they utilize a wider range of relations. In addition, we also evaluate the 
      effect of combining different measures of similarity and relatedness. Our
      hypothesis is that these combined measures will more closely correlate with human
      judgment, since they better reflect the rich variety of information humans use
      when assessing similarity and relatedness. METHOD: We evaluate our method on four
      reference standards. Three of the reference standards were annotated by human
      judges for relatedness and one was annotated for similarity. RESULTS: We found
      significant differences in the correlation of semantic similarity and relatedness
      measures with human judgment, depending on which semantic groups were involved.
      We also found that combining a definition based relatedness measure with an
      information content similarity measure resulted in significant improvements in
      correlation over individual measures. AVAILABILITY: The semantic similarity and
      relatedness package is an open source program available from
      http://umls-similarity.sourceforge.net/. The reference standards are available at
      http://www.people.vcu.edu/ approximately {}btmcinnes/downloads.html.

AB  - Comprehensive integration of large-scale omics resources such as genomes,
      transcriptomes and metabolomes will provide deeper insights into broader aspects 
      of molecular biology. For better understanding of plant biology, we aim to
      construct a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-derived gene expression network
      (GEN) repository for a broad range of plant species. So far we have incorporated 
      information about 745 high-quality mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq) samples from eight 
      plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum, Sorghum 
      bicolor, Vitis vinifera, Solanum tuberosum, Medicago truncatula and Glycine max) 
      from the public short read archive, digitally profiled the entire set of gene
      expression profiles, and drawn GENs by using correspondence analysis (CA) to take
      advantage of gene expression similarities. In order to understand the
      evolutionary significance of the GENs from multiple species, they were linked
      according to the orthology of each node (gene) among species. In addition to
      other gene expression information, functional annotation of the genes will
      facilitate biological comprehension. Currently we are improving the given gene
      annotations with natural language processing (NLP) techniques and manual
      curation. Here we introduce the current status of our analyses and the web
      database, PODC (Plant Omics Data Center; http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/podc/),
      now open to the public, providing GENs, functional annotations and additional
      comprehensive omics resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are associated with considerable
      health and economic costs. Surveillance of the more diagnostically challenging
      invasive fungal diseases, specifically of the sino-pulmonary system, is not
      feasible for many hospitals because case finding is a costly and labour intensive
      exercise. We developed text classifiers for detecting such IFDs from free-text
      radiology (CT) reports, using machine-learning techniques. METHOD: We obtained
      free-text reports of CT scans performed over a specific hospitalisation period
      (2003-2011), for 264 IFD and 289 control patients from three tertiary hospitals. 
      We analysed IFD evidence at patient, report, and sentence levels. Three
      infectious disease experts annotated the reports of 73 IFD-positive patients for 
      language suggestive of IFD at sentence level, and graded the sentences as to
      whether they suggested or excluded the presence of IFD. Reliable agreement
      between annotators was obtained and this was used as training data for our
      classifiers. We tested a variety of Machine Learning (ML), rule based, and hybrid
      systems, with feature types including bags of words, bags of phrases, and bags of
      concepts, as well as report-level structured features. Evaluation was carried out
      over a robust framework with separate Development and Held-Out datasets. RESULTS:
      The best systems (using Support Vector Machines) achieved very high recall at
      report- and patient-levels over unseen data: 95% and 100% respectively. Precision
      at report-level over held-out data was 71%; however, most of the associated
      false-positive reports (53%) belonged to patients who had a previous positive
      report appropriately flagged by the classifier, reducing negative impact in
      practice. CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning application holds the potential for
      developing systematic IFD surveillance systems for hospital populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Automatic detection of adverse drug reaction (ADR) mentions from text 
      has recently received significant interest in pharmacovigilance research. Current
      research focuses on various sources of text-based information, including social
      media-where enormous amounts of user posted data is available, which have the
      potential for use in pharmacovigilance if collected and filtered accurately. The 
      aims of this study are: (i) to explore natural language processing (NLP)
      approaches for generating useful features from text, and utilizing them in
      optimized machine learning algorithms for automatic classification of ADR
      assertive text segments; (ii) to present two data sets that we prepared for the
      task of ADR detection from user posted internet data; and (iii) to investigate if
      combining training data from distinct corpora can improve automatic
      classification accuracies. METHODS: One of our three data sets contains annotated
      sentences from clinical reports, and the two other data sets, built in-house,
      consist of annotated posts from social media. Our text classification approach
      relies on generating a large set of features, representing semantic properties
      (e.g., sentiment, polarity, and topic), from short text nuggets. Importantly,
      using our expanded feature sets, we combine training data from different corpora 
      in attempts to boost classification accuracies. RESULTS: Our feature-rich
      classification approach performs significantly better than previously published
      approaches with ADR class F-scores of 0.812 (previously reported best: 0.770),
      0.538 and 0.678 for the three data sets. Combining training data from multiple
      compatible corpora further improves the ADR F-scores for the in-house data sets
      to 0.597 (improvement of 5.9 units) and 0.704 (improvement of 2.6 units)
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our research results indicate that using advanced NLP 
      techniques for generating information rich features from text can significantly
      improve classification accuracies over existing benchmarks. Our experiments
      illustrate the benefits of incorporating various semantic features such as
      topics, concepts, sentiments, and polarities. Finally, we show that integration
      of information from compatible corpora can significantly improve classification
      performance. This form of multi-corpus training may be particularly useful in
      cases where data sets are heavily imbalanced (e.g., social media data), and may
      reduce the time and costs associated with the annotation of data in the future.

AB  - Biologists often pose queries to search engines and biological databases to
      obtain answers related to ongoing experiments. This is known to be a time
      consuming, and sometimes frustrating, task in which more than one query is posed 
      and many databases are consulted to come to possible answers for a single fact.
      Question answering comes as an alternative to this process by allowing queries to
      be posed as questions, by integrating various resources of different nature and
      by returning an exact answer to the user. We have surveyed the current solutions 
      on question answering for Biology, present an overview on the methods which are
      usually employed and give insights on how to boost performance of systems in this
      domain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Provide a detailed understanding of the information workflow processes
      related to translating health promotion materials for limited English proficiency
      individuals in order to inform the design of context-driven machine translation
      (MT) tools for public health (PH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied a cognitive 
      work analysis framework to investigate the translation information workflow
      processes of two large health departments in Washington State. Researchers
      conducted interviews, performed a task analysis, and validated results with PH
      professionals to model translation workflow and identify functional requirements 
      for a translation system for PH. RESULTS: The study resulted in a detailed
      description of work related to translation of PH materials, an information
      workflow diagram, and a description of attitudes towards MT technology. We
      identified a number of themes that hold design implications for incorporating MT 
      in PH translation practice. A PH translation tool prototype was designed based on
      these findings. DISCUSSION: This study underscores the importance of
      understanding the work context and information workflow for which systems will be
      designed. Based on themes and translation information workflow processes, we
      identified key design guidelines for incorporating MT into PH translation work.
      Primary amongst these is that MT should be followed by human review for
      translations to be of high quality and for the technology to be adopted into
      practice. CONCLUSION: The time and costs of creating multilingual health
      promotion materials are barriers to translation. PH personnel were interested in 
      MT's potential to improve access to low-cost translated PH materials, but
      expressed concerns about ensuring quality. We outline design considerations and a
      potential machine translation tool to best fit MT systems into PH practice.

TI  - The use of natural language processing of infusion notes to identify outpatient
      infusions.
PG  - 86-92
LID - 10.1002/pds.3720 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Outpatient infusions are commonly missing in Veterans Health Affairs
      (VHA) pharmacy dispensing data sets. Currently, Healthcare Common Procedure
      Coding System (HCPCS) codes are used to identify outpatient infusions, but
      concerns exist if they correctly capture all infusions and infusion-related data 
      such as dose and date of administration. We developed natural language processing
      (NLP) software to extract infusion information from medical text infusion notes. 
      The objective was to compare the sensitivity of three approaches to identify
      infliximab administration dates and infusion doses against a reference standard
      established from the Veterans Affairs rheumatoid arthritis (VARA) registry.
      METHODS: We compared the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of NLP
      to that of HCPCS codes in identifying the correct date and dose of infliximab
      infusions against a human extracted reference standard. RESULTS: The sensitivity 
      was 0.606 (0.585-0.627) for HCPCS alone, 0.858 (0.842-0.873) for NLP alone, and
      0.923 (0.911-0.934) for the two methods combined, with a PPV of 0.735
      (0.716-0.754), 0.976 (0.969-0.983), and 0.957 (0.948-0.965) for each method,
      respectively. The mean dose of infliximab was 433 mg in the reference standard,
      337 mg from HCPCS, 434 mg from NLP, and 426 mg from the combined method.
      CONCLUSIONS: HCPCS codes alone are not sufficient to accurately identify
      infliximab infusion dates and doses in the VHA system. The use of NLP
      significantly improved the sensitivity and PPV for estimating infusion dates and 
      doses, especially when combined with HCPCS codes.

TI  - Secure Secondary Use of Clinical Data with Cloud-based NLP Services. Towards a
      Highly Scalable Research Infrastructure.
PG  - 276-82
LID - 10.3414/ME13-01-0133 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The secondary use of clinical data provides large opportunities for
      clinical and translational research as well as quality assurance projects. For
      such purposes, it is necessary to provide a flexible and scalable infrastructure 
      that is compliant with privacy requirements. The major goals of the cloud4health 
      project are to define such an architecture, to implement a technical prototype
      that fulfills these requirements and to evaluate it with three use cases.
      METHODS: The architecture provides components for multiple data provider sites
      such as hospitals to extract free text as well as structured data from local
      sources and de-identify such data for further anonymous or pseudonymous
      processing. Free text documentation is analyzed and transformed into structured
      information by text-mining services, which are provided within a cloud-computing 
      environment. Thus, newly gained annotations can be integrated along with the
      already available structured data items and the resulting data sets can be
      uploaded to a central study portal for further analysis. RESULTS: Based on the
      architecture design, a prototype has been implemented and is under evaluation in 
      three clinical use cases. Data from several hundred patients provided by a
      University Hospital and a private hospital chain have already been processed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Cloud4health has shown how existing components for secondary use of 
      structured data can be complemented with text-mining in a privacy compliant
      manner. The cloud-computing paradigm allows a flexible and dynamically adaptable 
      service provision that facilitates the adoption of services by data providers
      without own investments in respective hardware resources and software tools.

TI  - Automatic abstraction of imaging observations with their characteristics from
      mammography reports.
PG  - e81-92
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-003009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiology reports are usually narrative, unstructured text, a format 
      which hinders the ability to input report contents into decision support systems.
      In addition, reports often describe multiple lesions, and it is challenging to
      automatically extract information on each lesion and its relationships to
      characteristics, anatomic locations, and other information that describes it. The
      goal of our work is to develop natural language processing (NLP) methods to
      recognize each lesion in free-text mammography reports and to extract its
      corresponding relationships, producing a complete information frame for each
      lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We built an NLP information extraction pipeline in
      the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) NLP toolkit. Sequential
      processing modules are executed, producing an output information frame required
      for a mammography decision support system. Each lesion described in the report is
      identified by linking it with its anatomic location in the breast. In order to
      evaluate our system, we selected 300 mammography reports from a hospital report
      database. RESULTS: The gold standard contained 797 lesions, and our system
      detected 815 lesions (780 true positives, 35 false positives, and 17 false
      negatives). The precision of detecting all the imaging observations with their
      modifiers was 94.9, recall was 90.9, and the F measure was 92.8. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      NLP system extracts each imaging observation and its characteristics from
      mammography reports. Although our application focuses on the domain of
      mammography, we believe our approach can generalize to other domains and may
      narrow the gap between unstructured clinical report text and structured
      information extraction needed for data mining and decision support.

TI  - HARVEST, a longitudinal patient record summarizer.
PG  - 263-74
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002945 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe HARVEST, a novel point-of-care patient summarization and
      visualization tool, and to conduct a formative evaluation study to assess its
      effectiveness and gather feedback for iterative improvements. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: HARVEST is a problem-based, interactive, temporal visualization of
      longitudinal patient records. Using scalable, distributed natural language
      processing and problem salience computation, the system extracts content from the
      patient notes and aggregates and presents information from multiple care
      settings. Clinical usability was assessed with physician participants using a
      timed, task-based chart review and questionnaire, with performance differences
      recorded between conditions (standard data review system and HARVEST). RESULTS:
      HARVEST displays patient information longitudinally using a timeline, a problem
      cloud as extracted from notes, and focused access to clinical documentation.
      Despite lack of familiarity with HARVEST, when using a task-based evaluation,
      performance and time-to-task completion was maintained in patient review
      scenarios using HARVEST alone or the standard clinical information system at our 
      institution. Subjects reported very high satisfaction with HARVEST and interest
      in using the system in their daily practice. DISCUSSION: HARVEST is available for
      wide deployment at our institution. Evaluation provided informative feedback and 
      directions for future improvements. CONCLUSIONS: HARVEST was designed to address 
      the unmet need for clinicians at the point of care, facilitating review of
      essential patient information. The deployment of HARVEST in our institution
      allows us to study patient record summarization as an informatics intervention in
      a real-world setting. It also provides an opportunity to learn how clinicians use
      the summarizer, enabling informed interface and content iteration and
      optimization to improve patient care.

TI  - Automatic identification of methotrexate-induced liver toxicity in patients with 
      rheumatoid arthritis from the electronic medical record.
PG  - e151-61
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002642 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To improve the accuracy of mining structured and unstructured
      components of the electronic medical record (EMR) by adding temporal features to 
      automatically identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with
      methotrexate-induced liver transaminase abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Codified information and a string-matching algorithm were applied to a RA cohort 
      of 5903 patients from Partners HealthCare to select 1130 patients with potential 
      liver toxicity. Supervised machine learning was applied as our key method. For
      features, Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) 
      was used to extract standard vocabulary from relevant sections of the
      unstructured clinical narrative. Temporal features were further extracted to
      assess the temporal relevance of event mentions with regard to the date of
      transaminase abnormality. All features were encapsulated in a 3-month-long
      episode for classification. Results were summarized at patient level in a
      training set (N=480 patients) and evaluated against a test set (N=120 patients). 
      RESULTS: The system achieved positive predictive value (PPV) 0.756, sensitivity
      0.919, F1 score 0.829 on the test set, which was significantly better than the
      best baseline system (PPV 0.590, sensitivity 0.703, F1 score 0.642). Our
      innovations, which included framing the phenotype problem as an episode-level
      classification task, and adding temporal information, all proved highly
      effective. CONCLUSIONS: Automated methotrexate-induced liver toxicity phenotype
      discovery for patients with RA based on structured and unstructured information
      in the EMR shows accurate results. Our work demonstrates that adding temporal
      features significantly improved classification results.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The trade-off between the speed and simplicity of dictionary-based
      term recognition and the richer linguistic information provided by more advanced 
      natural language processing (NLP) is an area of active discussion in clinical
      informatics. In this paper, we quantify this trade-off among text processing
      systems that make different trade-offs between speed and linguistic
      understanding. We tested both types of systems in three clinical research tasks: 
      phase IV safety profiling of a drug, learning adverse drug-drug interactions, and
      learning used-to-treat relationships between drugs and indications. MATERIALS: We
      first benchmarked the accuracy of the NCBO Annotator and REVEAL in a manually
      annotated, publically available dataset from the 2008 i2b2 Obesity Challenge. We 
      then applied the NCBO Annotator and REVEAL to 9 million clinical notes from the
      Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE) and used
      the resulting data for three research tasks. RESULTS: There is no significant
      difference between using the NCBO Annotator and REVEAL in the results of the
      three research tasks when using large datasets. In one subtask, REVEAL achieved
      higher sensitivity with smaller datasets. CONCLUSIONS: For a variety of tasks,
      employing simple term recognition methods instead of advanced NLP methods results
      in little or no impact on accuracy when using large datasets. Simpler
      dictionary-based methods have the advantage of scaling well to very large
      datasets. Promoting the use of simple, dictionary-based methods for population
      level analyses can advance adoption of NLP in practice.

TI  - Assessing the role of a medication-indication resource in the treatment relation 
      extraction from clinical text.
PG  - e162-76

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of the MEDication Indication (MEDI)
      resource and SemRep for identifying treatment relations in clinical text.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first processed clinical documents with SemRep to
      extract the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts and the treatment
      relations between them. Then, we incorporated MEDI into a simple algorithm that
      identifies treatment relations between two concepts if they match a
      medication-indication pair in this resource. For a better coverage, we expanded
      MEDI using ontology relationships from RxNorm and UMLS Metathesaurus. We also
      developed two ensemble methods, which combined the predictions of SemRep and the 
      MEDI algorithm. We evaluated our selected methods on two datasets, a Vanderbilt
      corpus of 6864 discharge summaries and the 2010 Informatics for Integrating
      Biology and the Bedside (i2b2)/Veteran's Affairs (VA) challenge dataset. RESULTS:
      The Vanderbilt dataset included 958 manually annotated treatment relations. A
      double annotation was performed on 25% of relations with high agreement (Cohen's 
      kappa = 0.86). The evaluation consisted of comparing the manual annotated
      relations with the relations identified by SemRep, the MEDI algorithm, and the
      two ensemble methods. On the first dataset, the best F1-measure results achieved 
      by the MEDI algorithm and the union of the two resources (78.7 and 80,
      respectively) were significantly higher than the SemRep results (72.3). On the
      second dataset, the MEDI algorithm achieved better precision and significantly
      lower recall values than the best system in the i2b2 challenge. The two systems
      obtained comparable F1-measure values on the subset of i2b2 relations with both
      arguments in MEDI. CONCLUSIONS: Both SemRep and MEDI can be used to extract
      treatment relations from clinical text. Knowledge-based extraction with MEDI
      outperformed use of SemRep alone, but superior performance was achieved by
      integrating both systems. The integration of knowledge-based resources such as
      MEDI into information extraction systems such as SemRep and the i2b2 relation
      extractors may improve treatment relation extraction from clinical text.

      application for the generation of clinical statement entries.
PG  - 132-42
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002991 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Electronic medical records with encoded entries should 
      enhance the semantic interoperability of document exchange. However, it remains a
      challenge to encode the narrative concept and to transform the coded concepts
      into a standard entry-level document. This study aimed to use a novel approach
      for the generation of entry-level interoperable clinical documents. METHODS:
      Using HL7 clinical document architecture (CDA) as the example, we developed three
      pipelines to generate entry-level CDA documents. The first approach was a
      semi-automatic annotation pipeline (SAAP), the second was a natural language
      processing (NLP) pipeline, and the third merged the above two pipelines. We
      randomly selected 50 test documents from the i2b2 corpora to evaluate the
      performance of the three pipelines. RESULTS: The 50 randomly selected test
      documents contained 9365 words, including 588 Observation terms and 123 Procedure
      terms. For the Observation terms, the merged pipeline had a significantly higher 
      F-measure than the NLP pipeline (0.89 vs 0.80, p<0.0001), but a similar F-measure
      to that of the SAAP (0.89 vs 0.87). For the Procedure terms, the F-measure was
      not significantly different among the three pipelines. CONCLUSIONS: The
      combination of a semi-automatic annotation approach and the NLP application seems
      to be a solution for generating entry-level interoperable clinical documents.

TI  - A novel method of adverse event detection can accurately identify venous
      thromboembolisms (VTEs) from narrative electronic health record data.
PG  - 155-65
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002768 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), which include deep vein thrombosis
      (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), are associated with significant mortality,
      morbidity, and cost in hospitalized patients. To evaluate the success of
      preventive measures, accurate and efficient methods for monitoring VTE rates are 
      needed. Therefore, we sought to determine the accuracy of statistical natural
      language processing (NLP) for identifying DVT and PE from electronic health
      record data. METHODS: We randomly sampled 2000 narrative radiology reports from
      patients with a suspected DVT/PE in Montreal (Canada) between 2008 and 2012. We
      manually identified DVT/PE within each report, which served as our reference
      standard. Using a bag-of-words approach, we trained 10 alternative support vector
      machine (SVM) models predicting DVT, and 10 predicting PE. SVM training and
      testing was performed with nested 10-fold cross-validation, and the average
      accuracy of each model was measured and compared. RESULTS: On manual review, 324 
      (16.2%) reports were DVT-positive and 154 (7.7%) were PE-positive. The best DVT
      model achieved an average sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.85), specificity 
      of 0.98 (98% CI 0.97 to 0.99), positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.89 (95% CI
      0.85 to 0.93), and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99).
      The best PE model achieved sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.85), specificity
      of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98 to 0.99), PPV of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.92), and AUC of 0.99
      (95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Statistical NLP can accurately identify VTE
      from narrative radiology reports.

PG  - e93-103
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002702 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research identifies specific care coordination activities used by
      Aging in Place (AIP) nurse care coordinators and home healthcare (HHC) nurses
      when coordinating care for older community-dwelling adults and suggests a method 
      to quantify care coordination. METHODS: A care coordination ontology was built
      based on activities extracted from 11,038 notes labeled with the Omaha Case
      management category. From the parsed narrative notes of every patient, we mapped 
      the extracted activities to the ontology, from which we computed problem profiles
      and quantified care coordination for all patients. RESULTS: We compared two
      groups of patients: AIP who received enhanced care coordination (n=217) and HHC
      who received traditional care (n=691) using 128,135 narratives notes. Patients
      were tracked from the time they were admitted to AIP or HHC until they were
      discharged. We found that patients in AIP received a higher dose of care
      coordination than HHC in most Omaha problems, with larger doses being given in
      AIP than in HHC in all four Omaha categories. CONCLUSIONS: 'Communicate' and
      'manage' activities are widely used in care coordination. This confirmed the
      expert hypothesis that nurse care coordinators spent most of their time
      communicating about their patients and managing problems. Overall, nurses
      performed care coordination in both AIP and HHC, but the aggregated dose across
      Omaha problems and categories is larger in AIP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The P300 speller is intended to restore communication to patients with
      advanced neuromuscular disorders, but clinical implementation may be hindered by 
      several factors, including system setup, burden, and cost. Our goal was to
      develop a method that can overcome these barriers by optimizing EEG electrode
      number and placement for P300 studies within a population of subjects. METHODS: A
      Gibbs sampling method was developed to find the optimal electrode configuration
      given a set of P300 speller data. The method was tested on a set of data from 15 
      healthy subjects using an established 32-electrode pattern. Resulting electrode
      configurations were then validated using online prospective testing with a naive 
      Bayes classifier in 15 additional healthy subjects. RESULTS: The method yielded a
      set of four posterior electrodes (PO(8), PO(7), POZ, CPZ), which produced results
      that are likely sufficient to be clinically effective. In online prospective
      validation testing, no significant difference was found between subjects'
      performances using the reduced and the full electrode configurations.
      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method can find reduced sets of electrodes within a
      subject population without reducing performance. SIGNIFICANCE: Reducing the
      number of channels may reduce costs, set-up time, signal bandwidth, and
      computation requirements for practical online P300 speller implementation.

AB  - Systems approaches to analyzing disease phenotype networks in combination with
      protein functional interaction networks have great potential in illuminating
      disease pathophysiological mechanisms. While many genetic networks are readily
      available, disease phenotype networks remain largely incomplete. In this study,
      we built a large-scale Disease Manifestation Network (DMN) from 50,543 highly
      accurate disease-manifestation semantic relationships in the United Medical
      Language System (UMLS). Our new phenotype network contains 2305 nodes and 373,527
      weighted edges to represent the disease phenotypic similarities. We first
      compared DMN with the networks representing genetic relationships among diseases,
      and demonstrated that the phenotype clustering in DMN reflects common disease
      genetics. Then we compared DMN with a widely-used disease phenotype network in
      previous gene discovery studies, called mimMiner, which was extracted from the
      textual descriptions in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). We
      demonstrated that DMN contains different knowledge from the existing phenotype
      data source. Finally, a case study on Marfan syndrome further proved that DMN
      contains useful information and can provide leads to discover unknown disease
      causes. Integrating DMN in systems approaches with mimMiner and other data offers
      the opportunities to predict novel disease genetics. We made DMN publicly
      available at nlp/case.edu/public/data/DMN.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the frequency of and variables associated with thoracic
      metastasis in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) to help
      optimize the use of cross-sectional chest imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
      retrospective institutional review board-approved study included 631 patients
      (343 men; mean age, 55 years; range, 19-94 years) with pathologically confirmed
      GIST who were identified with a natural language processing algorithm in a review
      of radiologic reports from January 2004 through October 2012, followed by manual 
      confirmation. The requirement for informed consent was waived. Available imaging,
      pathologic, and clinical records were reviewed to confirm the presence of
      abdominal and thoracic metastases. The association of age; sex; size, location,
      mitotic count, and risk stratification of the primary tumor; initial treatment;
      presence of abdominal metastases; and bulky abdominal metastases (more than 10
      lesions larger than 1 cm, or more than five lesions with at least one larger than
      5 cm) with development of thoracic metastases, the primary outcome measure, was
      studied by using logistic regression. RESULTS: During median follow-up of 61.4
      months (interquartile range, 37.8-93 months), 401 of 631 (63.5%) patients
      developed metastatic disease (median interval, 6.9 months; interquartile range,
      0-25.6 months), all with peritoneal (n = 324) and/or hepatic metastases (n =
      303). Bulky abdominal metastases were found in 218 (34.5%) patients. Although 579
      (91.8%) patients underwent chest imaging, only 64 of 631 (10.1%) developed
      thoracic metastases (median, 51.4 months; interquartile range, 36-78.7 months);
      all had bulky abdominal metastases except one patient who presented with
      symptomatic scapular metastasis. Only bulky abdominal metastasis was
      significantly associated with the development of thoracic metastasis (P < .0001; 
      odds ratio, 42.6; range, 8.6-211.5). CONCLUSION: Thoracic metastases are
      relatively uncommon in patients with GIST and are significantly associated only
      with presence of bulky abdominal metastases.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The importance of data standards when integrating
      clinical research data has been recognized. The common data element (CDE) is a
      consensus-based data element for data harmonization and sharing between clinical 
      researchers, it can support data standards adoption and mapping. However, the
      lack of a suitable methodology has become a barrier to data standard adoption.
      Our aim was to demonstrate an approach that allowed clinical researchers to
      design electronic case report forms (eCRFs) that complied with the data standard.
      METHODS: We used a multi-technique approach, including information retrieval,
      natural language processing and an ontology-based knowledgebase to facilitate
      data standard adoption using the eCRF design. The approach took research
      questions as query texts with the aim of retrieving and associating relevant CDEs
      with the research questions. RESULTS: The approach was implemented using a
      CDE-based eCRF builder, which was evaluated using CDE- related questions from
      CRFs used in the Parkinson Disease Biomarker Program, as well as CDE-unrelated
      questions from a technique support website. Our approach had a precision of 0.84,
      a recall of 0.80, a F-measure of 0.82 and an error of 0.31. Using the 303 testing
      CDE-related questions, our approach responded and provided suggested CDEs for
      88.8% (269/303) of the study questions with a 90.3% accuracy (243/269). The
      reason for any missed and failed responses was also analyzed. CONCLUSION: This
      study demonstrates an approach that helps to cross the barrier that inhibits data
      standard adoption in eCRF building and our evaluation reveals the approach has
      satisfactory performance. Our CDE-based form builder provides an alternative
      perspective regarding data standard compliant eCRF design.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To standardize and objectivize treatment response assessment in
      oncology, guidelines have been proposed that are driven by radiological
      measurements, which are typically communicated in free-text reports defying
      automated processing. We study through inter-annotator agreement and natural
      language processing (NLP) algorithm development the task of pairing measurements 
      that quantify the same finding across consecutive radiology reports, such that
      each measurement is paired with at most one other ("partial uniqueness"). METHODS
      AND MATERIALS: Ground truth is created based on 283 abdomen and 311 chest CT
      reports of 50 patients each. A pre-processing engine segments reports and
      extracts measurements. Thirteen features are developed based on volumetric
      similarity between measurements, semantic similarity between their respective
      narrative contexts and structural properties of their report positions. A Random 
      Forest classifier (RF) integrates all features. A "mutual best match" (MBM)
      post-processor ensures partial uniqueness. RESULTS: In an end-to-end evaluation, 
      RF has precision 0.841, recall 0.807, F-measure 0.824 and AUC 0.971; with MBM,
      which performs above chance level (P<0.001), it has precision 0.899, recall
      0.776, F-measure 0.833 and AUC 0.935. RF (RF+MBM) has error-free performance on
      52.7% (57.4%) of report pairs. DISCUSSION: Inter-annotator agreement of three
      domain specialists with the ground truth (kappa>0.960) indicates that the task is
      well defined. Domain properties and inter-section differences are discussed to
      explain superior performance in abdomen. Enforcing partial uniqueness has mixed
      but minor effects on performance. CONCLUSION: A combined machine
      learning-filtering approach is proposed for pairing measurements, which can
      support prospective (supporting treatment response assessment) and retrospective 
      purposes (data mining).

AB  - Outbreaks of infectious disease can pose a significant threat to human health.
      Thus, detecting and characterizing outbreaks quickly and accurately remains an
      important problem. This paper describes a Bayesian framework that links clinical 
      diagnosis of individuals in a population to epidemiological modeling of disease
      outbreaks in the population. Computer-based diagnosis of individuals who seek
      healthcare is used to guide the search for epidemiological models of population
      disease that explain the pattern of diagnoses well. We applied this framework to 
      develop a system that detects influenza outbreaks from emergency department (ED) 
      reports. The system diagnoses influenza in individuals probabilistically from
      evidence in ED reports that are extracted using natural language processing.
      These diagnoses guide the search for epidemiological models of influenza that
      explain the pattern of diagnoses well. Those epidemiological models with a high
      posterior probability determine the most likely outbreaks of specific diseases;
      the models are also used to characterize properties of an outbreak, such as its
      expected peak day and estimated size. We evaluated the method using both
      simulated data and data from a real influenza outbreak. The results provide
      support that the approach can detect and characterize outbreaks early and well
      enough to be valuable. We describe several extensions to the approach that appear
      promising.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 Evaluation Lab Task 1 was organized to
      evaluate the state of the art on the clinical text in (i) disorder mention
      identification/recognition based on Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
      definition (Task 1a) and (ii) disorder mention normalization to an ontology (Task
      1b). Such a community evaluation has not been previously executed. Task 1a
      included a total of 22 system submissions, and Task 1b included 17. Most of the
      systems employed a combination of rules and machine learners. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We used a subset of the Shared Annotated Resources (ShARe) corpus of
      annotated clinical text--199 clinical notes for training and 99 for testing
      (roughly 180 K words in total). We provided the community with the annotated gold
      standard training documents to build systems to identify and normalize disorder
      mentions. The systems were tested on a held-out gold standard test set to measure
      their performance. RESULTS: For Task 1a, the best-performing system achieved an
      F1 score of 0.75 (0.80 precision; 0.71 recall). For Task 1b, another system
      performed best with an accuracy of 0.59. DISCUSSION: Most of the participating
      systems used a hybrid approach by supplementing machine-learning algorithms with 
      features generated by rules and gazetteers created from the training data and
      from external resources. CONCLUSIONS: The task of disorder normalization is more 
      challenging than that of identification. The ShARe corpus is available to the
      community as a reference standard for future studies.

TI  - Validating drug repurposing signals using electronic health records: a case study
      of metformin associated with reduced cancer mortality.
PG  - 179-91
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002649 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Drug repurposing, which finds new indications for existing drugs, has
      received great attention recently. The goal of our work is to assess the
      feasibility of using electronic health records (EHRs) and automated informatics
      methods to efficiently validate a recent drug repurposing association of
      metformin with reduced cancer mortality. METHODS: By linking two large EHRs from 
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Mayo Clinic to their tumor registries,
      we constructed a cohort including 32,415 adults with a cancer diagnosis at
      Vanderbilt and 79,258 cancer patients at Mayo from 1995 to 2010. Using automated 
      informatics methods, we further identified type 2 diabetes patients within the
      cancer cohort and determined their drug exposure information, as well as other
      covariates such as smoking status. We then estimated HRs for all-cause mortality 
      and their associated 95% CIs using stratified Cox proportional hazard models. HRs
      were estimated according to metformin exposure, adjusted for age at diagnosis,
      sex, race, body mass index, tobacco use, insulin use, cancer type, and non-cancer
      Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: Among all Vanderbilt cancer patients,
      metformin was associated with a 22% decrease in overall mortality compared to
      other oral hypoglycemic medications (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88) and with a 39%
      decrease compared to type 2 diabetes patients on insulin only (HR 0.61; 95% CI
      0.50 to 0.73). Diabetic patients on metformin also had a 23% improved survival
      compared with non-diabetic patients (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85). These
      associations were replicated using the Mayo Clinic EHR data. Many site-specific
      cancers including breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate demonstrated reduced
      mortality with metformin use in at least one EHR. CONCLUSIONS: EHR data suggested
      that the use of metformin was associated with decreased mortality after a cancer 
      diagnosis compared with diabetic and non-diabetic cancer patients not on
      metformin, indicating its potential as a chemotherapeutic regimen. This study
      serves as a model for robust and inexpensive validation studies for drug
      repurposing signals using EHR data.

TI  - Measuring physician adherence with gout quality indicators: a role for natural
      language processing.
PG  - 273-9
LID - 10.1002/acr.22406 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate physician adherence with gout quality indicators (QIs) for
      medication use and monitoring, and behavioral modification (BM). METHODS: Gout
      patients were assessed for the QIs as follows: QI 1: initial allopurinol dosage
      <300 mg/day for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); QI 2: uric acid
      within 6 months of allopurinol start; and QI 3: complete blood count and
      creatinine phosphokinase within 6 months of colchicine initiation. Natural
      language processing (NLP) was used to analyze clinical narrative data from
      electronic medical records (EMRs) of overweight (body mass index >/=28 kg/m(2) ) 
      gout patients for BM counseling on gout-specific dietary restrictions, weight
      loss, and alcohol consumption (QI 4). Additional data included sociodemographics,
      comorbidities, and number of rheumatology and primary care visits. QI compliance 
      versus noncompliance was compared using chi-square analyses and
      independent-groups t-test. RESULTS: In 2,280 gout patients, compliance with QI
      was as follows: QI 1: 92.1%, QI 2: 44.8%, and QI 3: 7.7%. Patients compliant with
      QI 2 had more rheumatology visits at 3.5 versus 2.6 visits (P < 0.001), while
      those compliant with QI 3 had more CKD (P < 0.01). Of 1,576 eligible patients, BM
      counseling for weight loss occurred in 1,008 patients (64.0%), low purine diet in
      390 (24.8%), alcohol abstention in 137 (8.7%), and all 3 elements in 51 patients 
      (3.2%). Regular rheumatology clinic visits correlated with frequent advice on
      weight loss and gout-specific diet (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Rheumatology clinic 
      attendance was associated with greater QI compliance. NLP proved a valuable tool 
      for measuring BM as documented in the clinical narrative of EMRs.

TI  - Automated clinical trial eligibility prescreening: increasing the efficiency of
      patient identification for clinical trials in the emergency department.
PG  - 166-78
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002887 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (1) To develop an automated eligibility screening (ES) approach for
      clinical trials in an urban tertiary care pediatric emergency department (ED);
      (2) to assess the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP), information
      extraction (IE), and machine learning (ML) techniques on real-world clinical data
      and trials. DATA AND METHODS: We collected eligibility criteria for 13 randomly
      selected, disease-specific clinical trials actively enrolling patients between
      January 1, 2010 and August 31, 2012. In parallel, we retrospectively selected
      data fields including demographics, laboratory data, and clinical notes from the 
      electronic health record (EHR) to represent profiles of all 202795 patients
      visiting the ED during the same period. Leveraging NLP, IE, and ML technologies, 
      the automated ES algorithms identified patients whose profiles matched the trial 
      criteria to reduce the pool of candidates for staff screening. The performance
      was validated on both a physician-generated gold standard of trial-patient
      matches and a reference standard of historical trial-patient enrollment
      decisions, where workload, mean average precision (MAP), and recall were
      assessed. RESULTS: Compared with the case without automation, the workload with
      automated ES was reduced by 92% on the gold standard set, with a MAP of 62.9%.
      The automated ES achieved a 450% increase in trial screening efficiency. The
      findings on the gold standard set were confirmed by large-scale evaluation on the
      reference set of trial-patient matches. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: By exploiting 
      the text of trial criteria and the content of EHRs, we demonstrated that NLP-,
      IE-, and ML-based automated ES could successfully identify patients for clinical 
      trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of locking plate and screw implants on
      postoperative infection rate in dogs >50 kg undergoing tibial plateau leveling
      osteotomy (TPLO). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: Dogs >50 kg
      (n = 208) that had TPLO. METHODS: Medical records (January 2003-September 2011)
      were reviewed for dogs that had TPLO. Type of implant used (locking plate and
      screw fixation [LP] and dynamic compression plate and screw fixation [NLP]), use 
      of postoperative antibiotics and presence of postoperative infection were
      recorded. Multivariate analysis was performed. RESULTS: Forty dogs (21.3%) had
      clinical signs compatible with postoperative infection. A positive microbiology
      swab was available in 16/40 cases (40%). Administration of postoperative
      antibiotics was associated with a lower incidence of infection (P = .006) and the
      use of NLP was associated with a higher incidence of infection (P = .01).
      CONCLUSIONS: Use of LP construct and postoperative antibiotic therapy
      significantly decreased infection rate in dogs >50 kg that have TPLO.

TI  - TypingSuite: integrated software for presenting stimuli, and collecting and
      analyzing typing data.
PG  - 127-39
LID - 10.1007/s10936-014-9283-9 [doi]
AB  - Research into typing patterns has broad applications in both psycholinguistics
      and biometrics (i.e., improving security of computer access via each user's
      unique typing patterns). We present a new software package, TypingSuite, which
      can be used for presenting visual and auditory stimuli, collecting typing data,
      and summarizing and analyzing the data. TypingSuite is a Java-based software
      package that is platform-independent and open-source. To validate TypingSuite as 
      a beneficial tool for researchers who are interested in keystroke dynamics, two
      studies were conducted. First, a behavioural experiment based on single word
      typing was conducted that replicated two well-known findings in typing research, 
      namely the lexicality and frequency effects. The results confirmed that words are
      typed faster than pseudowords and that high frequency words are typed faster than
      low frequency words. Second, in regard to biometrics, it was also shown that
      typing data from the same user are more similar than data from different users.
      Because TypingSuite allows its users to easily implement an experiment and to
      collect and analyze data within a single software package, it holds promise for
      being a valuable educational and research tool in language-related sciences such 
      as psycholinguistics and natural language processing.

TI  - Validation of Case Finding Algorithms for Hepatocellular Cancer From
      Administrative Data and Electronic Health Records Using Natural Language
      Processing.
PG  - e9-14
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0b013e3182a30373 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cases from
      automated data is needed for efficient and valid quality improvement initiatives 
      and research. We validated HCC International Classification of Diseases, 9th
      Revision (ICD-9) codes, and evaluated whether natural language processing by the 
      Automated Retrieval Console (ARC) for document classification improves HCC
      identification. METHODS: We identified a cohort of patients with ICD-9 codes for 
      HCC during 2005-2010 from Veterans Affairs administrative data. Pathology and
      radiology reports were reviewed to confirm HCC. The positive predictive value
      (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity of ICD-9 codes were calculated. A split
      validation study of pathology and radiology reports was performed to develop and 
      validate ARC algorithms. Reports were manually classified as diagnostic of HCC or
      not. ARC generated document classification algorithms using the Clinical Text
      Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. ARC performance was compared with
      manual classification. PPV, sensitivity, and specificity of ARC were calculated. 
      RESULTS: A total of 1138 patients with HCC were identified by ICD-9 codes. On the
      basis of manual review, 773 had HCC. The HCC ICD-9 code algorithm had a PPV of
      0.67, sensitivity of 0.95, and specificity of 0.93. For a random subset of 619
      patients, we identified 471 pathology reports for 323 patients and 943 radiology 
      reports for 557 patients. The pathology ARC algorithm had PPV of 0.96,
      sensitivity of 0.96, and specificity of 0.97. The radiology ARC algorithm had PPV
      of 0.75, sensitivity of 0.94, and specificity of 0.68. CONCLUSIONS: A combined
      approach of ICD-9 codes and natural language processing of pathology and
      radiology reports improves HCC case identification in automated data.
