TI PROMOTING STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS IN PUBLIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
SO INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The field of public management is methodologically underdeveloped as compared to other disciplines. In order to derive the fullest benefits of methodological advancements, the field needs to invest in discussing and deliberating over the state of the art in methodological advances. Using state-of-the-art methods helps to produce knowledge that is useful for scholars and practitioners. This symposium aims to add to and improve the methodological toolkit available to public management scholars. We distinguish three categories that could strengthen the methodological toolkit: underutilized methods (such as ethnography), innovations in current methods (such as the synthetic control method for comparative case studies), and novel methods (such as natural language processing for content analysis). We hope that this symposium encourages scholars to seek for novel and improved methods to produce research that lives up to scientific scrutiny and is valuable for practitioners.

AB We propose a new method for measuring innovativeness in the public sector using natural language processing techniques. Our approach extends traditional content analysis techniques by combining insights from linguistic theory and recent developments in computational techniques. We develop and employ phrase-level data dictionaries (using both noun phrases and verb phrases) from organizational documents. We use letters to the board of education from a sample of New Jersey school districts to develop measures of innovativenessone measure is based on expert assessments and the other is inductively derived. We perform rigorous tests of content validity, external validity, and predictive validity on these measures. We conclude with a discussion of implications of this new measurement approach and its potential applications to other public management contexts.

AB Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is very useful and popular in many application areas of expert and intelligent systems, such as machine learning, finance, data and text mining, multimedia mining, image processing, anomaly detection, defense applications, bioinformatics and natural language processing. DR is widely applied for better data visualization and improving learning in all the above fields. In this manuscript, we propose a novel DR approach namely, Noisy-free Length Discriminant Analysis (NLDA) by developing Noisy-free Relevant Pattern Selection (NRPS). Traditional pattern selection methods discriminate boundary and non-boundary patterns with the help of class information and nearest neighbors. And these methods completely ignore noisy patterns which may degrade the performance of subsequent subspace learning. To overcome this, we develop Noisy-free Relevant Pattern Selection (NRPS), in which data instances are partitioned into boundary, non-boundary and noisy patterns. With the help of noisy free boundary and non-boundary patterns, Noisy-free Length Discriminant Analysis (NLDA) has been proposed by developing new within and between-class scatters. These scatters model discriminations between lengths (L-2-norms) of different class instances by considering only boundary and non-boundary patterns, while ignoring noisy patterns. A cosine hyperbolic frame work has been developed to formulate the objective of NLDA. Moreover, NLDA can also model the discrimination of multimodal data as different class data may consist of different lengths. Experimental study conducted on the synthesized data, UCI, and leeds butterfly databases. Moreover, an experimental study over human and computer interaction, i.e., face recognition (one of the application areas of expert and intelligent systems), has been performed. And, these studies prove that the proposed method can produce better discriminated subspace compare to the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Community Question Answering (cQA) services encourage their members to ask any kind of question, which later on can get multiple answers from other community fellows. The research objective of this paper is understanding, and particularly automatically detecting, what motivates community members to ask questions to their unknown peers.
   In so doing, we first crawled a set of cQA questions from Yahoo! Answers, each of which was manually labelled according to their multiple motivations afterwards. Thus, one of the innovative aspects of our work is exploring a wide variety of multi-label classification strategies for the automatic recognition of concurrent motivations behind cQA questions. In order to build effective models, high-dimensional feature spaces were constructed on top of assorted linguistic features, this way discovering some linguistic traits that characterize some of these combinations.
   Overall, our experiments reveal that multi-label classification frameworks hold a real promise for this task. More precisely, our best configuration finished with a Hamming Score of 0.71. In terms of features, our outcomes unveil that the concurrence of motivations is likely to be signalled by the complexity in writing and the distribution of entity mentions across the entire question, ergo both question titles and bodies are required to be able to recognize their confluence.

AB Aspect extraction is one of the fundamental steps in analyzing the characteristics of opinions, feelings and emotions expressed in textual data provided for a certain topic. Current aspect extraction techniques are mostly based on topic models; however, employing only topic models causes incoherent aspects to be generated. Therefore, this paper aims to discover more precise aspects by incorporating co-occurrence relations as prior domain knowledge into the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. In the proposed method, first, the preliminary aspects are generated based on LDA. Then, in an iterative manner, the prior knowledge is extracted automatically from co-occurrence relations and similar aspects of relevant topics. Finally, the extracted knowledge is incorporated into the LDA model. The iterations improve the quality of the extracted aspects.
   The competence of the proposed ELDA for the aspect extraction task is evaluated through experiments on two datasets in the English and Persian languages. The experimental results indicate that ELDA not only outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of topic coherence and precision, but also has no particular dependency on the written language and can be applied to all languages with reasonable accuracy. Thus, ELDA can impact natural language processing applications, particularly in languages with limited linguistic resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Affective computing is an emerging interdisciplinary research field bringing together researchers and practitioners from various fields, ranging from artificial intelligence, natural language processing, to cognitive and social sciences. With the proliferation of videos posted online (e.g., on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for product reviews, movie reviews, political views, and more, affective computing research has increasingly evolved from conventional unimodal analysis to more complex forms of multimodal analysis. This is the primary motivation behind our first of its kind, comprehensive literature review of the diverse field of affective computing. Furthermore, existing literature surveys lack a detailed discussion of state of the art in multimodal affect analysis frameworks, which this review aims to address. Multimodality is defined by the presence of more than one modality or channel, e.g., visual, audio, text, gestures, and eye gage. In this paper, we focus mainly on the use of audio, visual and text information for multimodal affect analysis, since around 90% of the relevant literature appears to cover these three modalities. Following an overview of different techniques for unimodal affect analysis, we outline existing methods for fusing information from different modalities. As part of this review, we carry out an extensive study of different categories of state-of-the-art fusion techniques, followed by a critical analysis of potential performance improvements with multimodal analysis compared to unimodal analysis. A comprehensive overview of these two complementary fields aims to form the building blocks for readers, to better understand this challenging and exciting research field. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Existing methods for extracting titles from HTML web page mostly rely on visual and structural features. However, this approach fails in the case of service-based web pages because advertisements are often given more visual emphasize than the main headlines. To improve the current state-of-the-art, we propose a novel method that combines statistical features, linguistic knowledge, and text segmentation. Using annotated English corpus, we learn the morphosyntactic characteristics of known titles and define a part-of-speech tag patterns that help to extract candidate phrases from the web page. To evaluate the proposed method, we compared two datasets Titler and Mopsi and evaluated the extracted features using four classifiers: Naive Bayes, k-NN, SVM, and clustering. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperform the solution used by Google from 0.58 to 0.85 on Titler corpus and from 0.43 to 0.55 on Mopsi dataset, and offers a readily available solution for the title extraction problem.

AB Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an important approach in construction project risk management. It emphasises that previous knowledge and experience of accidents and risks are highly valuable and could contribute to avoiding similar risks in new situations. In the CBR cycle, retrieving useful information is the first and the most important step. To facilitate the CBR for practical use, some researchers and organisations have established construction accident databases and their size is growing. However, as those documents are written in everyday language using different ways of expression, how information in similar cases is retrieved quickly and accurately from the database is still a huge challenge. In order to improve the efficiency and performance of risk case retrieval, this paper proposes an approach of combining the use of two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, i.e. Vector Space Model (VSM) and semantic query expansion, and outlines a framework for this Risk Case Retrieval System. A prototype system is developed using the Python programming language to support the implementation of the proposed method. Preliminary test results show that the proposed system is capable of retrieving similar cases automatically and returning, for example, the top 10 similar cases.

AB We study convex multi-objective Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming problems (MINLPs), which are characterized by multiple objective functions and non linearities, features that appear in real-world applications. To derive a good approximated set of non-dominated points for convex multi-objective MINLPs, we propose a heuristic based on a branch-and-bound algorithm. It starts with a set of feasible points, obtained, at the root node of the enumeration tree, by iteratively solving, with an 8-constraint method, a single objective model that incorporates the other objective functions as constraints. Lower bounds are derived by optimally solving Non-Linear Programming problems (NLPs). Each leaf node of the enumeration tree corresponds to a convex multi-objective NLP, which is solved heuristically by varying the weights in a weighted sum approach. In order to improve the obtained points and remove dominated ones, a tailored refinement procedure is designed. Although the proposed method makes no assumptions on the number of objective functions nor on the type of the variables, we test it on bi-objective mixed binary problems. In particular, as a proof-of-concept, we tested the proposed heuristic algorithm on instances of a real-world application concerning power generation, and instances of the convex biobjective Non-Linear Knapsack Problem. We compared the obtained results with those derived by well-known scalarization methods, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the shaping of a drug's delivery-in this case, nicotine-to maximize its efficacy. Previous research: (i) furnishes a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of this drug's metabolism; (ii) shows that the drug-delivery problem is proper, meaning that its optimal solution is periodic; (iii) shows that the underlying PKPD model is differentially flat; and (iv) exploits differential flatness to solve the problem by optimizing the coefficients of a truncated Fourier expansion of the flat output trajectory. In contrast, the work in this article provides insight into the structure of the theoretical solution to this optimal periodic control (OPC) problem. First, we argue for the existence of a bijection between feasible periodic input and state trajectories of the problem. Second, we exploit Pontryagin's maximum principle to show that the optimal periodic solution has a bang-singular-bang structure. Building on these insights, this article proposes two different numerical methods for solving this OPC problem. One method uses nonlinear programming (NLP) to optimize the states at which the optimal solution transitions between the different solution arcs. The second method approximates the control input trajectory as piecewise constant and optimizes the discrete values of the input sequence. The paper concludes by discussing the computational costs of these two algorithms as well as the importance of the associated insights into the structure of the optimal solution trajectory.

AB Context: App stores provide a software development space and a market place that are both different from those to which we have become accustomed for traditional software development: The granularity is finer and there is a far greater source of information available for research and analysis. Information is available on price, customer rating and, through the data mining approach presented in this paper, the features claimed by app developers. These attributes make app stores ideal for empirical software engineering analysis.
   Objective: This paper(1) exploits App Store Analysis to understand the rich interplay between app customers and their developers.
   Method: We use data mining to extract app descriptions, price, rating, and popularity information from the Blackberry World App Store, and natural language processing to elicit each apps' claimed features from its description.
   Results: The findings reveal that there are strong correlations between customer rating and popularity (rank of app downloads). We found evidence for a mild correlation between app price and the number of features claimed for the app and also found that higher priced features tended to be lower rated by their users. We also found that free apps have significantly (p-value < 0.001) higher ratings than non free apps, with a moderately high effect size (<(A)over cap>(12) = 0.68). All data from our experiments and analysis are made available on-line to support further investigations. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key NLP task, which is all the more challenging on Web and user-generated content with their diverse and continuously changing language. This paper aims to quantify how this diversity impacts state-of-the-art NER methods, by measuring named entity (NE) and context variability, feature sparsity, and their effects on precision and recall. In particular, our findings indicate that NER approaches struggle to generalise in diverse genres with limited training data. Unseen NEs, in particular, play an important role, which have a higher incidence in diverse genres such as social media than in more regular genres such as newswire. Coupled with a higher incidence of unseen features more generally and the lack of large training corpora, this leads to significantly lower Fl scores for diverse genres as compared to more regular ones. We also find that leading systems rely heavily on surface forms found in training data, having problems generalising beyond these, and offer explanations for this observation. (C) 2017 The Authors.

ID SELECTION
AB Community Question-Answering platforms are massive knowledge bases of questions and answers pairs produced by their members. In other to provide a vibrant service, they are compelled to provide answers to new posted questions as soon as possible. However, since their dynamic requires their own users to answer questions, there is an inherent delay between posting time and the arrival of good answers. In fact, many of these new questions might be already asked and satisfactorily answered in the past. Ergo, one of the pressing needs of these services is capitalizing on good answers given to related resolved questions across their large-scale knowledge base. To that end, current approaches have studied the effectiveness of human-generated web queries across search logs in fetching related questions and potential good answers from these community archives. However, this kind of strategy is not suitable for questions without click-through data, in particular those recently posted, limiting their capability of providing them with real-time answers.
   In this paper, we propose an approach to find related questions across the cQA knowledge base, which automatically generate effective search strings directly from question titles and bodies. In so doing, we automatically construct a massive corpus of related questions on top of the relationships yielded by their click-through graph, and generated candidate queries by inspecting dependency paths across the title and body of each question afterwards. Then, we utilize this corpus for automatically annotating the retrieval power of each of these candidates. With this labelled corpus, we study the effectiveness of several learning to rank models enriched with assorted linguistically-motivated properties. Thus deducing the linguistic structure of automatically generated search strings that are effective in finding related questions. Since these models are inferred solely from each question itself, they can be used when search log data (i.e., web queries) is unavailable.
   Overall, our experiments underline the effectiveness of our approach, in particular our outcomes indicate that named entity recognition is instrumental in structuring and recognizing 2-5 terms effective queries. Furthermore, we carry out experiments considering and ignoring question bodies, and we show that profiting only from question titles is more promising, but most effective queries are harder to detect. Conversely, adding question bodies makes the retrieval of past related questions noisier, but their content helps to generalize models capable of identifying more effective candidates.

AB Deep learning techniques for Sentiment Analysis have become very popular. They provide automatic feature extraction and both richer representation capabilities and better performance than traditional feature based techniques (i.e., surface methods). Traditional surface approaches are based on complex manually extracted features, and this extraction process is a fundamental question in feature driven methods. These long-established approaches can yield strong baselines, and their predictive capabilities can be used in conjunction with the arising deep learning methods. In this paper we seek to improve the performance of deep learning techniques integrating them with traditional surface approaches based on manually extracted features. The contributions of this paper are sixfold. First, we develop a deep learning based sentiment classifier using a word embeddings model and a linear machine learning algorithm. This classifier serves as a baseline to compare to subsequent results. Second, we propose two ensemble techniques which aggregate our baseline classifier with other surface classifiers widely used in Sentiment Analysis. Third, we also propose two models for combining both surface and deep features to merge information from several sources. Fourth, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying the different models found in the literature, as well as the ones we propose. Fifth, we conduct several experiments to compare the performance of these models with the deep learning baseline. For this, we use seven public datasets that were extracted from the microblogging and movie reviews domain. Finally, as a result, a statistical study confirms that the performance of these proposed models surpasses that of our original baseline on Fl-Score. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As the prevalence of social media on the Internet, opinion mining has become an essential approach to analyzing so many data. Various applications appear in a wide range of industrial domains. Meanwhile, opinions have diverse expressions which bring along research challenges. Both of the practical demands and research challenges make opinion mining an active research area in recent years. In this paper, we present a review of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for opinion mining. First, we introduce general NLP techniques which are required for text preprocessing. Second, we investigate the approaches of opinion mining for different levels and situations. Then we introduce comparative opinion mining and deep learning approaches for opinion mining. Opinion summarization and advanced topics are introduced later. Finally, we discuss some challenges and open problems related to opinion mining. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Gradient flow; Nonlinear programming problem; Convergence analysis
ID INTERIOR-POINT ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS
AB This work presents a new numerical solution approach to nonlinear constrained optimization problems based on a gradient flow reformulation. The proposed solution schemes use self-tuning penalty parameters where the updating of the penalty parameter is directly embedded in the system of ODEs used in the reformulation, and its growth rate is linked to the violation of the constraints and variable bounds. The convergence properties of these schemes are analyzed, and it is shown that they converge to a local minimum asymptotically. Numerical experiments using a set of test problems, ranging from a few to several hundred variables, show that the proposed schemes are robust and converge to feasible points and local minima. Moreover, results suggest that the GF formulations were able to find the optimal solution to problems where conventional NLP solvers fail, and in less integration steps and time compared to a previously reported GF formulation.

AB A discretization-based algorithm for the global solution of semi-infinite programs (SIPs) is proposed, which is guaranteed to converge to a feasible, -optimal solution finitely under mild assumptions. The algorithm is based on the hybridization of two existing algorithms. The first algorithm (Mitsos in Optimization 60(10-11):1291-1308, 2011) is based on a restriction of the right-hand side of the constraints of a discretized SIP. The second algorithm (Tsoukalas and Rustem in Optim Lett 5(4):705-716, 2011) employs a discretized oracle problem and a binary search in the objective space. Hybridization of the approaches yields an algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence guarantees and the relatively tight upper bounding problem of the first approach while employing an oracle problem adapted from the second approach to generate cheap lower bounds and adaptive updates to the restriction of the first approach. These adaptive updates help in avoiding a dense population of the discretization. The hybrid algorithm is shown to be superior to its predecessors both theoretically and computationally. A proof of finite convergence is provided under weaker assumptions than the assumptions in the references. Numerical results from established SIP test cases are presented.

AB Reductions in spoken language complexity have been associated with the onset of various neurological disorders. The objective of this study is to analyze whether similar trends are found in professional football players who are at risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We compare changes in linguistic complexity (as indexed by the type-to-token ratio and lexical density) measured from the interview transcripts of players in the National Football League (NFL) to those measured from interview transcripts of coaches and/or front-office NFL executives who have never played professional football. A multilevel mixed model analysis reveals that exposure to the high-impact sport (vs no exposure) was associated with an overall decline in language complexity scores over time. This trend persists even after controlling for age as a potential confound. The results set the stage for a prospective study to test the hypothesis that language complexity decline is a harbinger of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB With the tremendous development of data science, using unstructured documents to analyze marketing dynamics is attracting a great deal of attention. In this letter, we propose an iterative scheme to extract the new words, which is often a bottleneck for Chinese natural language processing (NLP) in financial markets analysis. In contrast to existing static features, the key novelty is the proposed dynamic features that characterize the similarity of context patterns. Via iteration, distinguishable seed context patterns are extracted. Tested on a 203 MB corpus, 19 291 words representing emerging industries, entities, projects, and products were extracted with a precision of 89.8% and recall of 88.9%, which outperforms most competitor methods.

ID AUDITORY NEURONS; INTERFACE
AB Deep neural networks (DNN) have been shown to be very effective at solving challenging problems in several areas of computing, including vision, speech, and natural language processing. However, traditional platforms for implementing these DNNs are often very power hungry, which has lead to significant efforts in the development of configurable platforms capable of implementing these DNNs efficiently. One of these platforms, the IBM TrueNorth processor, has demonstrated very low operating power in performing visual computing and neural network classification tasks in real-time. The neuron computation, synaptic memory, and communication fabrics are all configurable, so that a wide range of network types and topologies can be mapped to TrueNorth. This reconfigurability translates into the capability to support a wide range of low-power functions in addition to feed-forward DNN classifiers, including for example, the audio processing functions presented here. In this work, we propose an end-to-end audio processing pipeline that is implemented entirely on a TrueNorth processor and designed to specifically leverage the highly-parallel, low-precision computing primitives TrueNorth offers. As part of this pipeline, we develop an audio feature extractor (LATTE) designed for implementation on TrueNorth, and explore the tradeoffs among several design variants in terms of accuracy, power, and performance. We customize the energy-efficient deep neuromorphic networks structures that our design utilizes as the classifier and show how classifier parameters can trade between power and accuracy. In addition to enabling a wide range of diverse functions, the reconfigurability of TrueNorth enables re-training and re-programming the system to satisfy varying energy, speed, area, and accuracy requirements. The resulting system's end-to-end power consumption can be as low as 14.43 mW, which would give up to 100 hours of continuous usage with button cell batteries (CR3023 1.5 Whr) or 450 hours with cellphone batteries (iPhone 6s 6.55 Whr).

AB We built a natural language processing (NLP) method to automatically extract clinical findings in radiology reports and characterize their level of change and significance according to a radiology-specific information model. We utilized a combination of machine learning and rule-based approaches for this purpose. Our method is unique in capturing different features and levels of abstractions at surface, entity, and discourse levels in text analysis. This combination has enabled us to recognize the underlying semantics of radiology report narratives for this task. We evaluated our method on radiology reports from four major healthcare organizations. Our evaluation showed the efficacy of our method in highlighting important changes (accuracy 99.2%, precision 96.3%, recall 93.5%, and F1 score 94.7%) and identifying significant observations (accuracy 75.8%, precision 75.2%, recall 75.7%, and F1 score 75.3%) to characterize radiology reports. This method can help clinicians quickly understand the key observations in radiology reports and facilitate clinical decision support, review prioritization, and disease surveillance.

AB This paper describes a method for handling multi-class and multi-label classification problems based on the support vector machine formalism. This method has been applied to the language identification problem in Twitter. The system evaluation was performed mainly on a Twitter data set developed in the TweetLID workshop. This data set contains bilingual tweets written in the most commonly used Iberian languages (i.e., Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Basque, and Galician) as well as the English language. We address the following problems: (1) social media texts. We propose a suitable tokenization that processes the peculiarities of Twitter; (2) multilingual tweets. Since a tweet can belong to more than one language, we need to use a multi-class and multi-label classifier; (3) similar languages. We study the main confusions among similar languages; and (4) unbalanced classes. We propose threshold-based strategy to favor classes with less data. We have also studied the use of Wikipedia and the addition of new tweets in order to increase the training data set. Additionally, we have tested our system on Bergsma corpus, a collection of tweets in nine languages, focusing on confusable languages using the Cyrillic, Arabic, and Devanagari alphabets. To our knowledge, we obtained the best results published on the TweetLID data set and results that are in line with the best results published on Bergsma data set.

TI Repetition between stakeholder (user) and system requirements
SO REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE User requirements; Stakeholder requirements; System requirements;
   Duplicate detection; Redundancy
ID MANAGEMENT
AB Stakeholder requirements (also known as user requirements) are defined at an early stage of a software project to describe the problem(s) to be solved. At a later stage, abstract solutions to those problems are prescribed in system requirements. The quality of these requirements has long been linked to the quality of the software system and its development or procurement process. However, little is known about the quality defect of redundancy between these two sets of requirements. Previous literature is anecdotal rather than exploratory, and so this paper empirically investigates its occurrence and consequences with a case study from a UK defense contractor. We report on a survey of sixteen consultants to understand their perception of the problem, and on an analysis of real-world software requirements documents using natural language processing techniques. We found that three quarters of the consultants had seen repetition in at least half of their projects. Additionally, we found that on average, a third of the requirement pairs' (comprised of a system and its related stakeholder requirement) description fields were repeated such that one requirement in the pair added only trivial information. That is, solutions were described twice while their respective problems were not described, which ultimately lead to suboptimal decisions later in the development process, as well as reduced motivation to read the requirements set. Furthermore, the requirement fields considered to be secondary to the primary "description" field, such as the "rationale" or "fit criterion" fields, had considerably more repetition within UR-SysR pairs. Finally, given that the UR-SysR repetition phenomena received most of its discussion in the literature over a decade ago, it is interesting that the survey participants did not consider its occurrence to have declined since then. We provide recommendations on preventing the defect, and describe the freely available tool developed to automatically detect its occurrence and alleviate its consequences.

AB When identifying and elaborating compliance requirements, analysts need to follow the cross references in legal texts and consider the additional information in the cited provisions. Enabling easier navigation and handling of cross references requires automated support for the detection of the natural language expressions used in cross references, the interpretation of cross references in their context, and the linkage of cross references to the targeted provisions. In this article, we propose an approach and tool support for automated detection and resolution of cross references. The approach leverages the structure of legal texts, formalized into a schema, and a set of natural language patterns for legal cross reference expressions. These patterns were developed based on an investigation of Luxembourg's legislation, written in French. To build confidence about their applicability beyond the context where they were observed, these patterns were validated against the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) by the Government of Ontario, Canada, written in both French and English. We report on an empirical evaluation where we assess the accuracy and scalability of our framework over several Luxembourgish legislative texts as well as PHIPA.

   answering; question retrieval; text mining
AB Community question answering (cQA) has become an important issue due to the popularity of cQA archives on the Web. This paper focuses on addressing the lexical gap problem in question retrieval. Question retrieval in cQA archives aims to find the existing questions that are semantically equivalent or relevant to the queried questions. However, the lexical gap problem brings a new challenge for question retrieval in cQA. In this paper, we propose to model and learn distributed word representations with metadata of category information within cQA pages for question retrieval using two novel category powered models. One is a basic category powered model called MB-NET and the other one is an enhanced category powered model called ME-NET which can better learn the distributed word representations and alleviate the lexical gap problem. To deal with the variable size of word representation vectors, we employ the framework of fisher kernel to transform them into the fixed-length vectors. Experimental results on large-scale English and Chinese cQA data sets show that our proposed approaches can significantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval models for question retrieval in cQA. Moreover, we further conduct our approaches on large-scale automatic evaluation experiments. The evaluation results show that promising and significant performance improvements can be achieved.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Sentiment analysis is an active research area in today's era due to the abundance of opinionated data present on online social networks. Semantic detection is a sub-category of sentiment analysis which deals with the identification of sentiment orientation in any text. Many sentiment applications rely on lexicons to supply features to a model. Various machine learning algorithms and sentiment lexicons have been proposed in research in order to improve sentiment categorization. Supervised machine learning algorithms and domain specific sentiment lexicons generally perform better as compared to the unsupervised or semi-supervised domain independent lexicon based approaches. The core hindrance in the application of supervised algorithms or domain specific sentiment lexicons is the unavailability of sentiment labeled training datasets for every domain. On the other hand, the performance of algorithms based on general purpose sentiment lexicons needs improvement. This research is focused on building a general purpose sentiment lexicon in a semi-supervised manner. The proposed lexicon defines word semantics based on Expected Likelihood Estimate Smoothed Odds Ratio that are then incorporated with supervised machine learning based model selection approach. A comprehensive performance comparison verifies the superiority of our proposed approach.

AB A dynamic optimization model for weed infestation control using selective herbicide application in a corn crop system is presented. The seed bank density of the weed population and frequency of dominant or recessive alleles are taken as state variables of the growing cycle. The control variable is taken as the dose-response function. The goal is to reduce herbicide usage, maximize profit in a pre-determined period of time and minimize the environmental impacts caused by excessive use of herbicides. The dynamic optimization model takes into account the decreased herbicide efficacy over time due to weed resistance evolution caused by selective pressure. The dynamic optimization problem involves discrete variables modeled as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem which was solved by an active set algorithm (ASA) for box-constrained optimization. Numerical simulations for a case study illustrate the management of the Bidens subalternans in a corn crop by selecting a sequence of only one type of herbicide. The results on optimal control discussed here will give support to make decision on the herbicide usage in regions where weed resistance was reported by field observations.

AB Online public response to health emergencies is a major and complex public health issue. This study employs hierarchical linear modeling to investigate the speed of online users' response to health emergency information on Chinese microblogging sites. The distribution of response speed for all posts is highly skewed. Only a minimal number of posts are forwarded in less than one minute. We further examine the effects of the characteristics of original messages as well as the effects of the factors of reposted messages and information transmitters, to determine the response time of messages on health emergencies. Original messages with different emotional orientations have different response times. The homophily of geographical location among dyadic information transmitters, the addressivity of reposted messages, and the degree of activity and popularity of information transmitters shorten the response time. This study expands the social amplification of risk model to an online context and contributes to the literature on information diffusion by identifying the effects of dyadic relationships among information transmitters. Practical implications are briefly discussed.

AB Nutrient signalling integrates and coordinates gene expression, metabolism and growth. However, its primary molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood in plants and animals. Here we report unique Ca2+ signalling triggered by nitrate with live imaging of an ultrasensitive biosensor in Arabidopsis leaves and roots. A nitrate-sensitized and targeted functional genomic screen identifies subgroup III Ca2+-sensor protein kinases (CPKs) as master regulators that orchestrate primary nitrate responses. A chemical switch with the engineered mutant CPK10(M141G) circumvents embryo lethality and enables conditional analyses of cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 triple mutants to define comprehensive nitrate-associated regulatory and developmental programs. Nitrate-coupled CPK signalling phosphorylates conserved NIN-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) transcription factors to specify the reprogramming of gene sets for downstream transcription factors, transporters, nitrogen assimilation, carbon/nitrogen metabolism, redox, signalling, hormones and proliferation. Conditional cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 and nlp7 mutants similarly impair nitrate-stimulated system-wide shoot growth and root establishment. The nutrient-coupled Ca2+ signalling network integrates transcriptome and cellular metabolism with shoot-root coordination and developmental plasticity in shaping organ biomass and architecture.

AB Controlling invasive species is a highly complex problem. The intricacy of the problem stems from the nonlinearity that is inherent in biological systems, consequently impeding researchers to obtain timely and cost-efficient treatment strategies over a planning horizon. To cope with the complexity of the invasive species problem, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that handles the problem as a full dynamic optimization model and solves it to optimality for the first time. We demonstrate the applicability of the model on a case study of sericea (Lespedeza cuneata) infestation by optimizing a spatially explicit model on a heterogeneous 10-by-10 grid landscape for a seven-year time period. We evaluate the solution quality of five different linearization methods that are used to obtain the MIP model, We also compare the model with its mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) equivalent and nonlinear programming (NLP) relaxation in terms of solution quality. The computational superiority and realism of the proposed MIP model demonstrate that our model has the potential to constitute the basis for future decision-support tools in invasive species management.

AB Background: The Internet, and its popularity, continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. Watching videos online is very popular; it is estimated that 500 h of video are uploaded onto YouTube, a video-sharing service, every minute and that, by 2019, video formats will comprise more than 80% of Internet traffic. Health-related videos are very popular on YouTube, but their quality is always a matter of concern. One approach to enhancing the quality of online videos is to provide additional educational health content, such as websites, to support health consumers. This study investigates the feasibility of building a content-based recommender system that links health consumers to reputable health educational websites from MedlinePlus for a given health video from YouTube.
   Methods: The dataset for this study includes a collection of health-related videos and their available metadata. Semantic technologies (such as SNOMED-CT and Bio-ontology) were used to recommend health websites from MedlinePlus. A total of 26 healths professionals participated in evaluating 253 recommended links for a total of 53 videos about general health, hypertension, or diabetes. The relevance of the recommended health websites from MedlinePlus to the videos was measured using information retrieval metrics such as the normalized discounted cumulative gain and precision at K.
   Results: The majority of websites recommended by our system for health videos were relevant, based on ratings by health professionals. The normalized discounted cumulative gain was between 46% and 90% for the different topics.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using a semantic content-based recommender system to enrich YouTube health videos. Evaluation with end-users, in addition to healthcare professionals, will be required to identify the acceptance of these recommendations in a nonsimulated information-seeking context.

DE Sentiment classification; Representation learning; Network embedding;
   Product reviews
AB There have been increasing interests in natural language processing to explore effective methods in learning better representations of text for sentiment classification in product reviews. However, most existing methods do not consider subtle interplays among words appeared in review text, authors of reviews and products the reviews are associated with. In this paper, we make use of a heterogeneous network to model the shared polarity in product reviews and learn representations of users, products they commented on and words they used simultaneously. The basic idea is to first construct a heterogeneous network which links users, products, words appeared in product reviews, as well as the polarities of the words. Based on the constructed network, representations of nodes are learned using a network embedding method, which are subsequently incorporated into a convolutional neural network for sentiment analysis. Evaluations on the product reviews, including IMDB, Yelp 2013 and Yelp 2014 datasets, show that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

DE Word embedding; Matrix factorization; Incremental learning
AB PSDVec is a Python/Perl toolbox that learns word embeddings, i.e. the mapping of words in a natural language to continuous vectors which encode the semantic/syntactic regularities between the words. PSDVec implements a word embedding learning method based on a weighted low-rank positive semi definite approximation. To scale up the learning process, we implement a blockwise online learning algorithm to learn the embeddings incrementally. This strategy greatly reduces the learning time of word embeddings on a large vocabulary, and can learn the embeddings of new words without re-learning the whole vocabulary. On 9 word similarity/analogy benchmark sets and 2 Natural Language Processing(NLP) tasks, PSDVec produces embeddings that has the best average performance among popular word embedding tools. PSDVec provides a new option for NLP practitioners. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TEXT CATEGORIZATION
AB With the rapid growth of information on the World Wide Web (WWW), classification of web documents has become important for efficient information retrieval. Relevancy of information retrieved can also be improved by considering semantic relatedness between words which is a basic research area in fields of natural language processing, intelligent retrieval, document clustering and classification, word sense disambiguation etc. The web search engine based semantic relationship from huge web corpus can improve classification of documents. This paper proposes an approach for web document classification that exploits information, including both page count and snippets. To identify the semantic relations between the query words, a lexical pattern extraction algorithm is applied on snippets. A sequential pattern clustering algorithm is used to form clusters of different patterns. The page count based measures are combined with the clustered patterns to define the features extracted from the word-pairs. These features are used to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM), in order to classify the web documents. Experimental results demonstrate 5% and 9% improvement in F1 measure for Reuters 21578 and 20 Newsgroup datasets in the classifier performance.

AB A Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a noteworthy role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, since it makes available the detection of proper nouns in unstructured texts. NER makes easier searching, retrieving, and extracting information seeing as the significant information in texts is usually sited around proper names. This paper suggests an efficient approach that can identify Named Entities (NE) in Arabic texts without the need for morphological or syntactic analysis or gazetteers. The goal of our approach is to provide a general framework for Arabic NE recognition. Within this framework; the system learns the recognition of NE automatically and induces NE systematically, starting from sample NE instances as seeds. This method takes advantage from the web, the approach learns from a web corpus. The seeds are used to identify the contexts in the web denoting NE and then the contexts identify new NE. Thorough experimental evaluation of our approach, the performances measured by recall, precision and f-measure conducted to recognize NE are promising. We obtained an overall rate of F-measure equal to 83%.

AB Aim: Now-a-days usage of chemical insecticides has become more restricted and creating many environmental problems. Therefore, objective of the present study was to evaluate the alternative control measures in form of botanicals against rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae L.) on stored wheat.
   Methodology: Six botanicals in powder form viz., neem leaf powder (NLP), neem kernel powder (NKP), dharek leaf powder (DLP), dharek kernel powder (DKP), castor leaf powder (CLP) and castor kernel powder (CKP) each at the rate of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 % (wlw) were tested by directly mixing into wheat grains against S. oryzae. An aliquot of 100g wheat sample was used in each treatment for maximum of 3 replications. Three jars were also kept for untreated control. Three jars of Deltamethrin 2.8 EC were also kept as standard check. Five pairs of 1-2 week old adult insects (1:1 female to male ratio) were released into each jar. The open tops of all the jars were covered with muslin and kept inside BOD incubator at 27 +/- 1 degrees C and 70 5 % R.H.
   Results: Deltamethrin 2.8 EC was highly effective as all the adult insects were died within 24 hours after their release. Among various powders, NKP at 2% was found best as it showed minimum grain damage (3.84%), weight loss (1.15%) and adult emergence (16.17), while maximum inhibition rate (92.58%) over the untreated control with maximum grain damage (21.16%), weight loss (13.83%) and adult emergence (157.58 adults). The NKP was followed by DKP, NLP, DLP, CKP and CLP. Seed viability was not adversely affected by any of the plant powders used in the studies.
   Interpretation: This study showed that 2% NKP the most effective compound over the other compounds and untreated control, and it can be used as botanical against S. oryzae in stored wheat.

AB Public repositories of large-scale biological data currently contain hundreds of thousands of experiments, including high-throughput sequencing and microarray data. The potential of using these resources to assemble data sets combining samples previously not associated is vastly unexplored. This requires the ability to associate samples with clear annotations and to relate experiments matched with different annotation terms. In this study, we illustrate the semantic annotation of Gene Expression Omnibus samples metadata using concepts from biomedical ontologies, focusing on the association of thousands of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) samples with a given target, tissue and disease state. Next, we demonstrate the feasibility of quantitatively measuring the semantic similarity between different samples, with the aim of combining experiments associated with the same or similar semantic annotations, thus allowing the generation of large data sets without the need of additional experiments. We compared tools based on Unified Medical Language System with tools that use topic-specific ontologies, showing that the second approach outperforms the first both in the annotation process and in the computation of semantic similarity measures. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of this approach by identifying semantically homogeneous groups of ChIP-seq samples targeting the Myc transcription factor, and expanding this data set with semantically coherent epigenetic samples.

AB Drug development is an expensive and time-consuming process; these could be reduced if the existing resources could be used to identify candidates for drug repurposing. This study sought to do this by text mining a large-scale literature repository to curate repurposed drug lists for different cancers. We devised a pattern-based relationship extraction method to extract disease-gene and gene-drug direct relationships from the literature. These direct relationships are used to infer indirect relationships using the ABC model. A gene-shared ranking method based on drug target similarity was then proposed to prioritize the indirect relationships. Our method of assessing drug target similarity correlated to existing anatomical therapeutic chemical code-based methods with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9311. The indirect relationships ranking method achieved a significant mean average precision score of top 100 most common diseases. We also confirmed the suitability of candidates identified for repurposing as anticancer drugs by conducting a manual review of the literature and the clinical trials. Eventually, for visualization and enrichment of huge amount of repurposed drug information, a chord diagram was demonstrated to rapidly identify two novel indications for further biological evaluations.

DE Knowledge management; Medical taxonomies; Online communities; Natural
   language processing; Semantic mapping
AB Background and Objective: Online communities of practice contain a wealth of information, stored in the free text of shared communications between community members. The Knowledge Maps (KMaps) system is designed to facilitate Knowledge Translation in online communities through multi-level analyses of the shared messages of these communications.
   Methods: Using state-of-the-art semantic mapping technologies (Metamap) the contents of the messages shared within an online community are mapped to terms from the MeSH medical lexicon, providing a multi-level topic-specific summary of the knowledge being shared within the community. Using the inherent hierarchical structure of the lexicon important insights can be found within the community.
   Results: The KMaps system was applied to two medical mailing lists, the PPML (archives from 2009-02 to 2013-02) and SURGINET (archives from 2012-01 to 2013-04), identifying 27,924 and 50,597 medical terms respectively. KMaps identified content areas where both communities found interest, specifically around Diseases, 22% and 24% of the total terms, while also identifying field-specific areas that were more popular: SURGINET expressed an interest in Anatomy (14% vs 4%) while the PPML was more interested in Drugs (19% vs 9%). At the level of the individual KMaps identified 6 PPML users and 9 SURGINET users that had noticeably more contributions to the community than their peers, and investigated their personal areas of interest.
   Conclusion: The KMaps system provides valuable insights into the structure of both communities, identifying topics of interest/shared content areas and defining content-profiles for individual community members. The system provides a valuable addition to the online KT process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Testing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with cost and risk to patients (e.g. radiation). To assess the appropriateness of imaging utilization at the provider level, it is important to know that provider's diagnostic yield (percentage of tests positive for the diagnostic entity of interest). However, determining diagnostic yield typically requires either time-consuming, manual review of radiology reports or the use of complex and/or proprietary natural language processing software.
   Objectives: The objectives of this study were twofold: 1) to develop and implement a simple, user configurable, and open-source natural language processing tool to classify radiology reports with high accuracy and 2) to use the results of the tool to design a provider-specific VTE imaging dashboard, consisting of both utilization rate and diagnostic yield.
   Methods: Two physicians reviewed a training set of 400 lower extremity ultrasound (UTZ) and computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) reports to understand the language used in VTE-positive and VTE-negative reports. The insights from this review informed the arguments to the five modifiable parameters of the NLP tool. A validation set of 2,000 studies was then independently classified by the reviewers and by the tool; the classifications were compared and the performance of the tool was calculated. Results: The tool was highly accurate in classifying the presence and absence of VTE for both the UTZ (sensitivity 95.7%; 95% CI 91.5-99.8, specificity 100%; 95% CI 100-100) and CTPA reports (sensitivity 97.1%; 95% CI 94.3-99.9, specificity 98.6%; 95% CI 97.8-99.4). The diagnostic yield was then calculated at the individual provider level and the imaging dashboard was created.
   Conclusions: We have created a novel NLP tool designed for users without a background in computer programming, which has been used to classify venous thromboembolism reports with a high degree of accuracy. The tool is open-source and available for download at http://iturrate.comisimpleNLP. Results obtained using this tool can be applied to enhance quality by presenting information about utilization and yield to providers via an imaging dashboard. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study aims to evaluate the association between Nd: YAG laser (with and without a photoabsorber) and two desensitizing dentifrices containing 15% NovaMin or 8% arginine, as potential treatments for dentin hypersensitivity (DH). DH was simulated by EDTA application for 2 min. Specimens were then analyzed with an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to ensure open dentin tubules (ODT), counted by using ImageJ software. Specimens were randomized into eight groups (n = 10): Laser (L), Laser+ Photoabsorber (LP), Arginine (A), Arginine+Laser (AL), Arginine+Laser+Photoabsorber (ALP), NovaMin (N), NovaMin+Laser (NL), and NovaMin+ Laser+ Photoabsorber (NLP). Laser irradiation was performed with 1 W, 100 mJ, 10 Hz, congruent to 85 J/cm(2); 4 irradiations of 10 s each, with 10 s intervals between them. After treatment, specimens were again analyzed by ESEM and submitted to erosive/abrasive cycling for 5 days. A final ESEM analysis was performed. Data were analyzed with two-way repeated measure ANOVA and Tukey tests (alpha = 0.05). After treatment, groups N, NL, and NLP presented the lower number of ODT, but they did not different from LP, ALP, and AL. Group A presented the highest number of ODT and it did not differ from group L. Groups L, AL, ALP, and LP presented intermediate results, without differing from each other. After cycling, group A presented the highest number of ODT and did not differ significantly from the other groups, except NLP. None of the associations tested presented better tubule occlusion than NovaMin by itself. Arginine was the only treatment that presented improved tubule occlusion when associated with Nd: YAG laser.

AB Based on a dataset on Astronomy and Astrophysics, hybrid cluster analyses have been conducted. In order to obtain an optimum solution and to analyse possible issues resulting from the bibliometric methodologies used, we have systematically studied three models and, within these models, two scenarios each. The hybrid clustering was based on a combination of bibliographic coupling and textual similarities using the Louvain method at two resolution levels. The procedure resulted in three clearly hierarchical structures with six and thirteen, seven and thirteen and finally five and eleven clusters, respectively. These structures are analysed with the help of a concordance table. The statistics reflect a high quality of classification. The results of these three models are presented, discussed and compared with each other. For labelling and interpreting clusters, core documents representing the obtained clusters are used. Furthermore, these core documents help depict the internal structure of the complete network and the clusters. This work has been done as part of the international project 'Measuring the Diversity of Research' and in the framework a special workshop on the comparative analysis of algorithms for the identification of topics in science organised in Berlin in August 2014.

AB Social communication skills are considered a core deficit in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Evidence-based practices that have emerged to address these critical skills in children with ASD have largely been implemented by researchers, teachers, and parents. Only recently have researchers studied paraprofessionals as implementers of these interventions. The following review examines studies in which paraprofessionals were taught to implement social communication interventions with young children with ASD. The seven articles that met inclusion criteria were evaluated with respect to (a) type of social communication intervention, (b) evidence of effectiveness, (c) training methods and components, (d) child outcomes. The primary intervention studies included pivotal response training (PRT), natural language paradigm (NLP), and incidental teaching strategies as well as mand training and general antecedent/consequent interventions. All studies reported improvements in paraprofessional implementation fidelity for the chosen intervention, five of which also reported corresponding improvements in child outcomes. Four studies provided definitive evidence of effectiveness for paraprofessional training. Feedback was the only training component used in all seven studies, in conjunction with at least one other component.

AB Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a major concern and point of emphasis for the medical profession, government, and society. A diverse set of techniques from epidemiology, statistics, and computer science are being proposed and studied for ADE discovery from observational health data (e.g., EHR and claims data), social network data (e.g., Google and Twitter posts), and other information sources. Methodologies are needed for evaluating, quantitatively measuring and comparing the ability of these various approaches to accurately discover ADEs. This work is motivated by the observation that text sources such as the Medline/Medinfo library provide a wealth of information on human health. Unfortunately, ADEs often result from unexpected interactions, and the connection between conditions and drugs is not explicit in these sources. Thus, in this work, we address the question of whether we can quantitatively estimate relationships between drugs and conditions from the medical literature. This paper proposes and studies a state-of-the-art NLP-based extraction of ADEs from text.

AB A key challenge of the Information Extraction in Natural Language Processing is the ability to recognise and classify temporal expressions (timexes). It is a crucial source of information about when something happens, how often something occurs or how long something lasts. Timexes extracted automatically from text, play a major role in many Information Extraction systems, such as question answering or event recognition. We prepared a broad specification of Polish timexes - PLIMEX. It is based on the state-of-the-art annotation guidelines for English, mainly TIMEX2 and TIMEX3 (a part of TimeML - Markup Language for Temporal and Event Expressions). We have expanded our specification for a description of the local meaning of timexes, based on LTIMEX annotation guidelines for English. Temporal description supports further event identification and extends event description model, focussing on anchoring events in time, events ordering and reasoning about the persistence of events. We prepared the specification, which is designed to address these issues, and we annotated all documents in Polish Corpus of Wroclaw University of Technology (KPWr) using our annotation guidelines. We also adapted our Liner2 machine learning system to recognise Polish timexes and we propose two-phase method to select a subset of features for Conditional Random Fields sequence labelling method. This article presents the whole process of corpus annotation, evaluation of inter-annotator agreement, extending Liner2 system with new features and evaluation of the recognition models before and after feature selection with the analysis of statistical significance of differences. Liner2 with presented models is available as open source software under the GNU General Public License.

TI NERA 2.0: Improving coverage and performance of rule-based named entity
   recognition for Arabic
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an essential task for many natural language processing systems, which makes use of various linguistic resources. NER becomes more complicated when the language in use is morphologically rich and structurally complex, such as Arabic. This language has a set of characteristics that makes it particularly challenging to handle. In a previous work, we have proposed an Arabic NER system that follows the hybrid approach, i.e. integrates both rule-based and machine learning-based NER approaches. Our hybrid NER system is the state-of-the-art in Arabic NER according to its performance on standard evaluation datasets. In this article, we discuss a novel methodology for overcoming the coverage drawback of rule-based NER systems in order to improve their performance and allow for automated rule update. The presented mechanism utilizes the recognition decisions made by the hybrid NER system in order to identify the weaknesses of the rule-based component and derive new linguistic rules aiming at enhancing the rule base, which will help in achieving more reliable and accurate results. We used ACE 2004 Newswire standard dataset as a resource for extracting and analyzing new linguistic rules for person, location and organization names recognition. We formulate each new rule based on two distinctive feature groups, i.e. Gazetteers of each type of named entities and Part-of-Speech tags, in particular noun and proper noun. Fourteen new patterns are derived, formulated as grammar rules, and evaluated in terms of coverage. The conducted experiments exploit a POS tagged version of the ACE 2004 NW dataset. The empirical results show that the performance of the enhanced rule-based system, i.e. NERA 2.0, improves the coverage of the previously misclassified person, location and organization named entities types by 69.93 per cent, 57.09 per cent and 54.28 per cent, respectively.

AB The rapid growth in digital information has raised considerable challenges in particular when it comes to automated content analysis. Social media such as twitter share a lot of its users' information about their events, opinions, personalities, etc. Paraphrase Identification (PI) is concerned with recognizing whether two texts have the same/similar meaning, whereas the Semantic Text Similarity (STS) is concerned with the degree of that similarity. This research proposes a state-of-the-art approach for paraphrase identification and semantic text similarity analysis in Arabic news tweets. The approach adopts several phases of text processing, features extraction and text classification. Lexical, syntactic, and semantic features are extracted to overcome the weakness and limitations of the current technologies in solving these tasks for the Arabic language. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) classifiers are trained using these features and are evaluated using a dataset prepared for this research. The experimentation results show that the approach achieves good results in comparison to the baseline results. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Extracting structured information from unstructured text is important for the qualitative data analysis. Leveraging NLP techniques for qualitative data analysis will effectively accelerate the annotation process, allow for large-scale analysis and provide more insights into the text to improve the performance. The first step for gaining insights from the text is Named Entity Recognition (NER). A significant challenge that directly impacts the performance of the NER process is the domain diversity in qualitative data. The represented text varies according to its domain in many aspects including taxonomies, length, formality and format. In this paper we discuss and analyse the performance of state-of-the-art tools across domains to elaborate their robustness and reliability. In order to do that, we developed a standard, expandable and flexible framework to analyse and test tools performance using corpora representing text across various domains. We performed extensive analysis and comparison of tools across various domains and from various perspectives. The resulting comparison and analysis are of significant importance for providing a holistic illustration of the state-of-the-art tools. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID AUTOMATIC DE-IDENTIFICATION
AB Background: Electronic medical records contain information of value for research, but contain identifiable and often highly sensitive confidential information. Patient-identifiable information cannot in general be shared outside clinical care teams without explicit consent, but anonymisation/de-identification allows research uses of clinical data without explicit consent.
   Results: This article presents CRATE (Clinical Records Anonymisation and Text Extraction), an open-source software system with separable functions: (1) it anonymises or de-identifies arbitrary relational databases, with sensitivity and precision similar to previous comparable systems; (2) it uses public secure cryptographic methods to map patient identifiers to research identifiers (pseudonyms); (3) it connects relational databases to external tools for natural language processing; (4) it provides a web front end for research and administrative functions; and (5) it supports a specific model through which patients may consent to be contacted about research.
   Conclusions: Creation and management of a research database from sensitive clinical records with secure pseudonym generation, full-text indexing, and a consent-to-contact process is possible and practical using entirely free and open-source software.

AB Academic credentials open up a wealth of opportunities. However, many people drop out of educational programs, such as community college and online courses. Prior research found that a brief self-regulation strategy can improve self-discipline and academic outcomes. Could this strategy support learners at large scale? Mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII) involves writing about positive outcomes associated with a goal, the obstacles to achieving it, and concrete if-then plans to overcome them. The strategy was developed in Western countries (United States, Germany) and appeals to individualist tendencies, which may reduce its efficacy in collectivist cultures such as India or China. We tested this hypothesis in two randomized controlled experiments in online courses (n = 17,963). Learners in individualist cultures were 32%(first experiment) and 15% (second experiment) more likely to complete the course following the MCII intervention than a control activity. In contrast, learners in collectivist cultures were unaffected by MCII. Natural language processing of written responses revealed that MCII was effective when a learner's primary obstacle was predictable and surmountable, such as everyday work or family obligations but not a practical constraint (e.g., Internet access) or a lack of time. By revealing heterogeneity in MCII's effectiveness, this research advances theory on self-regulation and illuminates how even highly efficacious interventions may be culturally bounded in their effects.
