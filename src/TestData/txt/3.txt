TI  - Text Mining of the Electronic Health Record: An Information Extraction Approach
      for Automated Identification and Subphenotyping of HFpEF Patients for Clinical
      Trials.

AB  - Precision medicine requires clinical trials that are able to efficiently enroll
      subtypes of patients in whom targeted therapies can be tested. To reduce the
      large amount of time spent screening, identifying, and recruiting patients with
      specific subtypes of heterogeneous clinical syndromes (such as heart failure with
      preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]), we need prescreening systems that are able 
      to automate data extraction and decision-making tasks. However, a major obstacle 
      is the vast amount of unstructured free-form text in medical records. Here we
      describe an information extraction-based approach that automatically converts
      unstructured text into structured data, which is cross-referenced against
      eligibility criteria using a rule-based system to determine which patients
      qualify for a major HFpEF clinical trial (PARAGON). We show that we can achieve a
      sensitivity and positive predictive value of 0.95 and 0.86, respectively. Our
      open-source algorithm could be used to efficiently identify and subphenotype
      patients with HFpEF and other disorders.

AB  - Using footage from body-worn cameras, we analyze the respectfulness of police
      officer language toward white and black community members during routine traffic 
      stops. We develop computational linguistic methods that extract levels of respect
      automatically from transcripts, informed by a thin-slicing study of participant
      ratings of officer utterances. We find that officers speak with consistently less
      respect toward black versus white community members, even after controlling for
      the race of the officer, the severity of the infraction, the location of the
      stop, and the outcome of the stop. Such disparities in common, everyday
      interactions between police and the communities they serve have important
      implications for procedural justice and the building of police-community trust.

AB  - De-identification, identifying information from data, such as protected health
      information (PHI) present in clinical data, is a critical step to enable data to 
      be shared or published. The 2016 Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS) 
      Neuropsychiatric Genome-scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) clinical
      natural language processing (NLP) challenge contains a de-identification track in
      de-identifying electronic medical records (EMRs) (i.e., track 1). The challenge
      organizers provide 1000 annotated mental health records for this track, 600 out
      of which are used as a training set and 400 as a test set. We develop a hybrid
      system for the de-identification task on the training set. Firstly, four
      individual subsystems, that is, a subsystem based on bidirectional LSTM
      (long-short term memory, a variant of recurrent neural network), a
      subsystem-based on bidirectional LSTM with features, a subsystem based on
      conditional random field (CRF) and a rule-based subsystem, are used to identify
      PHI instances. Then, an ensemble learning-based classifiers is deployed to
      combine all PHI instances predicted by above three machine learning-based
      subsystems. Finally, the results of the ensemble learning-based classifier and
      the rule-based subsystem are merged together. Experiments conducted on the
      official test set show that our system achieves the highest micro F1-scores of
      93.07%, 91.43% and 95.23% under the "token", "strict" and "binary token" criteria
      respectively, ranking first in the 2016 CEGS N-GRID NLP challenge. In addition,
      on the dataset of 2014 i2b2 NLP challenge, our system achieves the highest micro 
      F1-scores of 96.98%, 95.11% and 98.28% under the "token", "strict" and "binary
      token" criteria respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art systems. All
      these experiments prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TI  - Using prosody to infer discourse prominence in cochlear-implant users and

AB  - Cochlear implants (CIs) provide speech perception to adults with
      severe-to-profound hearing loss, but the acoustic signal remains severely
      degraded. Limited access to pitch cues is thought to decrease sensitivity to
      prosody in CI users, but co-occurring changes in intensity and duration may
      provide redundant cues. The current study investigates how listeners use these
      cues to infer discourse prominence. CI users and normal-hearing (NH) listeners
      were presented with sentences varying in prosody (accented vs. unaccented words) 
      while their eye-movements were measured to referents varying in discourse status 
      (given vs. new categories). In Experiment 1, all listeners inferred prominence
      when prosody on nouns distinguished categories ("SANDWICH"-->not sandals). In
      Experiment 2, CI users and NH listeners presented with natural speech inferred
      prominence when prosody on adjectives implied contrast across both categories and
      properties ("PINK horse"-->not the orange horse). In contrast, NH listeners
      presented with simulated CI (vocoded) speech were sensitive to acoustic
      differences in prosody, but did not use these cues to infer discourse status.
      Together, this suggests that exploiting redundant cues for comprehension varies
      with the demands of language processing and prior experience with the degraded
      signal.

TI  - Automatic Recognition of Symptom Severity From Psychiatric Evaluation Records.
LID - S1532-0464(17)30119-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2017.05.020 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a novel method for automatically recognizing symptom severity
      by using natural language processing of psychiatric evaluation records to extract
      features that are processed by machine learning techniques to assign a severity
      score to each record evaluated in the 2016 RDoC for Psychiatry Challenge from
      CEGS/N-GRID. The natural language processing techniques focused on (a) discerning
      the discourse information expressed in questions and answers; (b) identifying
      medical concepts that relate to mental disorders; and (c) accounting for the role
      of negation. The machine learning techniques rely on the assumptions that (1) the
      severity of a patient's positive valence symptoms exists on a latent continuous
      spectrum; and (2) all the patient's answers and narratives documented in the
      psychological evaluation records are informed by the patient's latent severity
      score along this spectrum. These assumptions motivated our two-step machine
      learning framework for automatically recognizing psychological symptom severity. 
      In the first step, the latent continuous severity score is inferred from each
      record; in the second step, the severity score is mapped to one of the four
      discrete severity levels used in the CEGS/N-GRID challenge. We evaluated three
      methods for inferring the latent severity score associated with each record: (i) 
      pointwise ridge regression; (ii) pairwise comparison-based classification; and
      (iii) a hybrid approach combining pointwise regression and the pairwise
      classifier. The second step was implemented using a tree of cascading support
      vector machine (SVM) classifiers. While the official evaluation results indicate 
      that all three methods are promising, the hybrid approach not only outperformed
      the pairwise and pointwise methods, but also produced the second highest
      performance of all submissions to the CEGS/N-GRID challenge with a normalized MAE
      score of 84.093% (where higher numbers indicate better performance). These
      evaluation results enabled us to observe that, for this task, considering
      pairwise information can produce more accurate severity scores than pointwise
      regression - an approach widely used in other systems for assigning severity
      scores. Moreover, our analysis indicates that using a cascading SVM tree
      outperforms traditional SVM classification methods for the purpose of determining
      discrete severity levels.
